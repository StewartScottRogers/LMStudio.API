<|begin_of_thought|>

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to create an in-memory library that merges sorted lists of integers into a single sorted list without duplicates. And it has to handle large inputs efficiently. Hmm.

First, the method needs to take N sorted lists of generics. Wait, but the output is integers. Oh right, the input lists are of type T which should be comparable since they're sorted. But the final merged list is integers and deduplicated. So maybe the input lists can have any type that implements IComparable or something? Or perhaps the method has to ensure that all elements can be converted to integers. Wait, but the problem statement says "returns a single sorted list of integers". So maybe each element in the input lists must be convertible to integer. That's an important point.

So, the parameters for the merge function would be a collection of lists, each list being a list of something that can be converted into integers. But how do I handle that? Maybe the method is designed such that all elements from the input lists are added as integers after conversion. But wait, if the input lists are already sorted in their original type (like strings "1", "2" etc.), converting them to integers and then sorting again would not be efficient. Wait, but the problem says the input lists are sorted. So each individual list is sorted according to its own natural ordering. For example, a list of strings ["1", "2"] is already sorted lexically, which may differ from numeric order. But when merged, they need to be converted to integers and then merged into a single sorted list with unique elements.

This complicates things because the input lists are sorted in their own types but we need them merged as integers. So perhaps each element in the input lists is first converted to an integer, then all these integers are merged and deduplicated while maintaining order. But how do we ensure that the conversion is valid? Like, what if there's a string "abc" that can't be converted to an integer? The problem description might not mention error handling here. Maybe it's assumed that all input elements are convertible to integers.

Assuming all inputs are valid, the method would process each element by converting to int, then collect all these ints into a single list, deduplicate them (since duplicates from different lists need to be removed once), and sort them again. But wait, the problem says "returns a single sorted list of integers that contains all elements from the input lists. The output list should not contain any duplicates." So even if the same integer appears in multiple input lists, it's only included once.

But merging N sorted lists into one sorted list with deduplication efficiently. How to do this optimally?

The standard approach for merging K sorted lists is using a priority queue (min-heap). Each list contributes its elements, but we need to process them in order. However, since the input lists are already sorted, perhaps we can take advantage of that.

Wait, but if each input list is sorted, then when combining all elements into one list, duplicates could be from different lists. So after converting all elements to integers, we have a collection where each element's source list may vary, and the order in which they are added affects the deduplication process. But since we need the final list to be sorted and contain no duplicates, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert all elements from input lists into integers.
2. Merge them into a single sorted list (since each original list is sorted).
3. Remove duplicates.

But merging multiple sorted lists into one sorted list can be done efficiently with a heap-based approach. However, if we first collect all integers and then sort, that would have O(N log N) time where N is the total number of elements. For large lists, this could be acceptable, but maybe there's a more efficient way.

Wait, but merging K sorted lists can be done in O(N log K) time using a min-heap. Let me think: each list is a pointer to its current element. The heap keeps track of the smallest current elements from each list. We pick the smallest, add it to the result, and then advance that list's pointer. This way, we process all N elements in O(N log K) time. But this requires that each list can be traversed efficiently. However, if the input lists are provided as IEnumerable or similar (like arrays or lists), then yes.

But in our case, after converting all elements to integers, merging them into a sorted list and deduping could involve:

- Collect all elements from all lists, convert to integers.
- Deduplicate them (e.g., using a hash set).
- Sort the deduplicated list.

This approach has O(N + M log M) time where N is total elements and M is unique elements. If the input lists are already sorted, then perhaps this method isn't leveraging their pre-sortedness. However, if we can merge them as they are (without converting first), but wait, they need to be converted to integers. So maybe:

Each list is a sequence of T elements that can be converted to integer. Each list is sorted according to the original type's ordering. For example, strings "1", "2" would be lex order, but when converted to integers 1 and 2, their numeric order may differ. Therefore, converting each element first before merging might not preserve the per-list sorting in terms of the integer values.

So perhaps the input lists are already sorted according to their original type's ordering, which may or may not align with the integer value's natural order. However, after conversion, all elements become integers, and we need the merged list to be sorted by their integer values. Therefore, the initial approach of collecting all integers, deduplicating them, and then sorting is correct but might have O(N log N) time complexity.

But for large lists (as per the problem statement), this could be too slow. So perhaps there's a way to merge the sorted lists while converting and deduping on the fly.

Alternatively, since each input list is already sorted in their original type's order, which might not correspond to integer numeric order, but after conversion, they may become unsorted. For example, a string list ["10", "2"] would convert to [10, 2], which is not sorted. So the initial approach of collecting all elements into integers and then sorting them is necessary.

So in that case, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert each element from every input list to integer.
2. Collect all these integers into a single collection (like a List<int>).
3. Sort this collection (which would take O(N log N) time).
4. Remove duplicates by traversing once and checking for consecutive duplicates (O(N) time).

This approach would work but might not be efficient enough for very large lists, as sorting is O(N log N). However, given that the problem requires handling large inputs efficiently, perhaps this approach isn't optimal.

Wait, but if the input lists are already sorted in their original type's order which may differ from integer numeric order, then converting and merging them would require a full sort. So there's no way around it. For example, list A is [10, 20], list B is ["5", "15"], when converted to integers, they become [10, 20] and [5,15]. Merging these lists as sorted (after conversion) would require a full sort again.

So the problem reduces to: after converting all elements from input lists into integers, collect them into one list, deduplicate, then sort. But this is O(N log N + D), where D is deduplication time.

But if N is very large, say billions of elements, this approach would not be feasible. However, the problem states that the library should handle large inputs efficiently. So perhaps a better approach is needed.

Wait, but how can we merge multiple sorted lists into one sorted list in O(N log K) time where K is the number of lists? That's the classic heap-based approach. Let's think:

Each input list is already sorted (but not necessarily according to integer numeric order). Wait no—because their original type may be strings, but when converted to integers, they need to be ordered numerically. So perhaps each input list, after conversion to integers, is not sorted. For example, a string list ["10", "2"] would convert to [10, 2], which is not sorted. Therefore, the initial lists are not sorted in integer order. Thus, merging them into a single sorted list requires that we first process each element as an integer and then merge all of them.

But this seems impossible unless we can sort each input list after conversion. However, if the input lists are already sorted according to their own type's ordering (like lex for strings), which does not correspond to numeric order, then merging them in a way that preserves the overall numeric order is only possible by converting all elements and sorting them all together.

So perhaps the problem statement has a mistake here. Wait, re-reading: "The library should provide a method that takes N sorted lists of generics and returns a single sorted list of integers that contains all elements from the input lists." So each input list is already sorted in their original type's natural order. But when converted to integers, they might not be sorted. Therefore, merging them into one sorted list (as integers) requires that after conversion, we sort them again.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Convert all elements from each input list to integer.
2. Collect these integers into a single list.
3. Sort this list in ascending order.
4. Remove duplicates by checking adjacent elements and keeping only one occurrence.

This approach would work but has O(N log N) time complexity for sorting, which might not be acceptable for very large N. However, given that the problem requires handling large lists efficiently, perhaps there's a way to optimize this.

Alternatively, if each input list is sorted in their original type's order, and after conversion to integers they are also sorted (e.g., strings "1", "2" which convert to 1 and 2), then we can merge them as K sorted lists. But how do we know that the converted integer lists are sorted? We don't. So unless there's a guarantee from the input lists, this approach isn't feasible.

Therefore, the correct way is to collect all integers, sort them, deduplicate.

But for very large N, sorting could be expensive. However, given that in C# .NET, List.Sort() uses an optimized version (like introsort), which is O(N log N) and can handle large data sets efficiently.

So perhaps the problem expects us to use this approach. But how about handling null or empty lists? For example, if a list is null, we skip it. If it's empty, also skip.

Now, for the fluent interface part: the library should allow chaining operations. So maybe the method is part of a class that returns an object which allows further processing. Or perhaps it's an extension method on IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>>?

Alternatively, create a MergeSorter class with a FluentlyMerge method or something similar.

But let's think about the API. The user would call a method like:

var merged = MergeSorter.Merge(list1, list2, ...);

Or maybe a static method in a Helper class.

Wait, but to provide a fluent interface, perhaps the method returns an object that can be further modified. For example:

var result = MergeSortedLists.Fluent().Add(list1).Add(list2).Merge();

But I'm not sure. The problem says "fluent interface to allow for easy chaining of operations". So maybe the merge operation is part of a builder pattern, where multiple lists are added and then merged.

Alternatively, create an instance that allows adding lists and then merging them when needed.

So perhaps the class has methods like AddList and Merge.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Create a method (or set of classes) that can take N lists.
2. Convert each element in these lists to integers.
3. Collect all converted integers into one list.
4. Sort this list.
5. Remove duplicates by checking adjacent elements (since after sorting, duplicates are consecutive).
6. Return the merged sorted deduplicated list.

But how to handle large inputs efficiently? For example, if we have a million elements each in 100 lists, converting all to integers and then sorting would be O(1e8 log 1e8) which is manageable with modern hardware but might take some time. However, the problem says "handle large lists efficiently", so perhaps using optimized data structures.

But given that .NET's List<T>.Sort is efficient, this approach should work for most cases.

Now, handling null or empty input lists: when adding a list to the collection, if it's null, we skip it. If it's empty, also skip. So during conversion and collection, these are ignored.

But how do we process each element from all lists? For example:

- Iterate over each input list (ignoring nulls).
- For each list, iterate through its elements.
- Convert each element to integer.
- Add to a master list.

But converting each element to an integer. How is this done? The input lists are of type T, but when passed into the method, how do we convert them?

Wait, the problem says "takes N sorted lists of generics". So the method signature would be something like:

public static List<int> Merge(List<IEnumerable<T>> lists) where T : ... ?

But since each element in the input lists must be convertible to integer, perhaps T is a type that can be parsed to int. But how?

Alternatively, the method could take a parameter of type IEnumerable<IEnumerable<object>>, and then convert each object to an integer.

But that would require handling possible conversion exceptions. However, the problem doesn't mention error handling, so maybe we assume all elements are convertible.

So the steps for code:

1. Create a static class (or a helper class) with a method Merge that takes params IEnumerable<T>[] lists.
2. Iterate through each list in the input arrays:
   a. Skip null lists or empty lists.
3. For each element in each list, convert to integer.
4. Collect all converted integers into a List<int>.
5. Sort this list.
6. Remove duplicates by creating a new list and checking if the current element is different from the last added one.
7. Return the resulting list.

But let's think about possible edge cases:

- All input lists are null or empty: return an empty list.
- Some elements can't be converted to integers: but problem says "the output list should not contain any duplicates" but doesn't mention exceptions. So perhaps we need to handle conversion errors, but the problem statement might assume all inputs are valid.

But since the problem does not specify error handling, perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that all elements in the input lists can be converted to integers.

Now, converting each element. For example, if T is a string, then Convert.ToInt32(element) would work. If it's another type like int or double, cast accordingly.

But how do we handle different types? The method has to accept any generic list where elements can be converted to integer. So perhaps the method takes an IEnumerable<IEnumerable<object>> and then converts each object to int.

Wait, but in C#, you can't have a method with a parameter of type params T[] because T is unknown unless constrained by a where clause. Alternatively, create a method that takes params IEnumerable<object>[] lists.

But this approach would allow any elements that can be converted to integer.

So the code outline:

public static List<int> Merge(params IEnumerable<object>[] lists)
{
    var integers = new List<int>();
    foreach (var list in lists)
    {
        if (list == null) continue;
        foreach (var item in list)
        {
            int num = Convert.ToInt32(item);
            integers.Add(num);
        }
    }
    // Sort and deduplicate
    integers.Sort();
    var result = new List<int>();
    int? previous = null;
    foreach (int current in integers)
    {
        if (!previous.HasValue || current != previous.Value)
        {
            result.Add(current);
            previous = current;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

But wait, this code has O(N log N) time complexity for sorting and O(M) for deduplication, where M is the number of unique elements. However, if N is very large (like millions), sorting could take a while. But given that the problem allows using LINQ-like methods, maybe this is acceptable.

But how to handle large inputs efficiently? The problem says "handle large lists efficiently". So perhaps we can use a more efficient approach for deduplication and merging sorted data.

Wait, but if after converting all elements to integers, they are sorted (since each original list was already sorted in their own type's order which may not correspond), then the initial approach is correct. But this would require that all input lists, when converted to integers, are themselves sorted. Otherwise, merging them as sorted lists isn't possible.

So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-read the problem statement:

"The library should provide a method that takes N sorted lists of generics and returns a single sorted list of integers that contains all elements from the input lists."

Wait, so each of the input lists is already sorted in their own type's natural order. For example, if a list is of strings ["1", "2"], it's lex-sorted. When converted to integers [1, 2], they are also numerically sorted. But another list could be ["3", "4"] which converts to [3,4]. Then merging these two would give [1,2,3,4] with no duplicates.

But if a list is of strings ["10", "5"], when converted to integers [10, 5], it's not sorted numerically. So the input lists are sorted in their own type's order (e.g., lex for strings), but after conversion to integer, they may not be sorted. Therefore, merging them into a single sorted list requires that all elements are collected, converted to integers, and then sorted again.

Therefore, the initial approach is correct: collect all integers from all lists, sort them, deduplicate.

But this has O(N log N) time complexity for sorting. For very large N (like billions), this could be a problem. However, given that .NET's List.Sort uses an efficient algorithm, perhaps it's manageable.

Now, the next part: creating a fluent interface.

A fluent interface allows method chaining. So maybe the Merge operation is part of a builder pattern. For example:

var merged = new Merger().Add(list1).Add(list2).Merge();

But how to structure this in code.

Alternatively, create a class called SortedMerger that has methods to add lists and then merge them.

So:

public class SortedMerger
{
    private readonly List<int> _integers;

    public SortedMerger()
    {
        _integers = new List<int>();
    }

    public SortedMerger Add<T>(IEnumerable<T> list)
    {
        if (list == null) return this;
        foreach (var item in list)
        {
            int num = Convert.ToInt32(item);
            _integers.Add(num);
        }
        return this;
    }

    public List<int> Merge()
    {
        // Sort and deduplicate
        _integers.Sort();
        var result = new List<int>();
        int? previous = null;
        foreach (var current in _integers)
        {
            if (!previous.HasValue || current != previous.Value)
            {
                result.Add(current);
                previous = current;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

Then, usage would be:

var merger = new SortedMerger();
merger.Add(list1).Add(list2).Merge();

But the problem requires a fluent interface that allows for easy chaining. So this approach fits.

Now, handling large lists: adding each element to _integers may not be efficient for very large N. But given that .NET's List is optimized, and appending elements is O(1) amortized, it should handle large data sets.

But wait, converting each item from the input list to int one by one could be slow. So perhaps using a more efficient conversion method.

Alternatively, use LINQ Select to project all items in the list to integers and then add them to the _integers list.

So in the Add method:

public SortedMerger Add<T>(IEnumerable<T> list)
{
    if (list == null) return this;
    var converted = list.Select(x => Convert.ToInt32(x)).ToList();
    _integers.AddRange(converted);
    return this;
}

This way, all elements are projected at once and added in bulk to the List<int>, which is more efficient.

Yes, that's better. So modifying the Add method to convert all items first before adding them.

Now, what about performance? For very large lists (e.g., 10 million elements), converting each element via Select could be manageable as long as it's done in bulk.

But how does Convert.ToInt32 handle different types? For example, if T is a string, it will work. If T is an int, no problem. But what if T is another type that can't be converted to int? The code would throw an exception during conversion. Since the problem statement doesn't mention error handling, perhaps we proceed under the assumption that all elements are convertible.

Now, for unit testing: need to write tests using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework (MSTest). Need to cover bounding conditions like null lists, empty lists, duplicates in input lists from different sources, etc.

Examples of test cases:

1. All lists are null or empty → returns empty list.
2. One list with elements [3, 5], another with [1, 4] → merged sorted list is [1,3,4,5].
3. Duplicate elements in different lists → deduplicated once.
4. Lists that contain elements which when converted to int are out of order (e.g., ["2", "1"] as strings) → after conversion and sorting, they become 1,2.

Now, coding style:

- Use explicit types, no implicit usings.
- No nullable references.
- Follow the specified naming conventions.

Also, the code should be placed in separate files. For example, the SortedMerger class would be in its own file (SortedMerger.cs).

But according to the problem statement, all classes must be in their own files, interfaces, enumerations, etc., each in separate files. So for this small library, perhaps we have:

- A class for the merger.
- If there are any interfaces or other constructs, but in this case, it's a simple class.

Now, code documentation: add comments to explain logic. For example, explaining that after converting all elements to integers, they are sorted and deduplicated.

But also, need to handle large numbers of input lists. The current approach adds each list's elements one by one (or in bulk), which should handle any number of lists as long as memory allows.

Now, the problem requires that the solution is a .NET 9.0 project (but .NET versions are typically like 6.0, 7.0, etc., perhaps it's a typo and meant to be .NET Core 3.x or .NET 5/6/7). But assuming that the user intended .NET Framework version 4.9? Or maybe it's a mistake and they mean .NET 6.0. Regardless, the code should be compatible with Visual Studio 2022.

So, in terms of project setup: create a class library project targeting .NET Standard or .NET Core 3.1 / 5.0 / 6.0, which is supported by VS 2022.

Now, putting it all together:

The code structure would be:

- A solution with one project (the library).
- The library contains a class SortedMerger in its own file.
- Unit tests are in another project, using MSTest.

But according to the problem statement, all coding is C#, no implicit usings, etc.

Now, let's draft the code for the SortedMerger class:

File: SortedMerger.cs

using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace MergingLibrary
{
    public class SortedMerger
    {
        private readonly List<int> _integers = new List<int>();

        public SortedMerger Add<T>(IEnumerable<T> list)
        {
            if (list == null) return this;
            var convertedList = list.Select(x => Convert.ToInt32(x)).ToList();
            _integers.AddRange(convertedList);
            return this;
        }

        public List<int> Merge()
        {
            // Sort the integers
            _integers.Sort();

            // Deduplicate by checking consecutive elements
            var result = new List<int>();
            int? previous = null;
            foreach (var current in _integers)
            {
                if (!previous.HasValue || current != previous.Value)
                {
                    result.Add(current);
                    previous = current;
                }
            }

            return result;
        }
    }
}

But according to coding style, all Tuples should use var types and postfix with Tuple. However, this code doesn't use tuples. So that's fine.

Now, the Add method is generic, but the problem states that the input lists are of generics. But in our case, since we're converting each element to int, the type parameter T can be any type that can be converted via Convert.ToInt32.

But what if someone passes a list with elements that cannot be converted? For example, passing a list of doubles where some values have fractional parts. In C#, Convert.ToInt32 will truncate them. But perhaps the problem expects exact conversion (like only integers). However, since the problem statement doesn't specify, we proceed under the assumption that all elements can be converted to integer via Convert.ToInt32.

Now, for unit tests:

File: SortedMergerTests.cs

using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using MergingLibrary;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace MergingLibrary.Tests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class SortedMergerTests
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_EmptyAndNullInputs()
        {
            var merger = new SortedMerger();
            var result = merger.Merge();
            Assert.AreEqual(0, result.Count);
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_SingleListWithElements()
        {
            var list1 = new List<int> { 3, 5 };
            var merger = new SortedMerger().Add(list1);
            var result = merger.Merge();
            CollectionAssert.AreEqual(new List<int> { 3, 5 }, result);
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_MultipleLists()
        {
            var list1 = new List<string> { "10", "2" };
            var list2 = new List<int> { 1, 5 };
            var merger = new SortedMerger().Add(list1).Add(list2);
            var result = merger.Merge();
            CollectionAssert.AreEqual(new List<int> { 1, 2, 5, 10 }, result);
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_Duplicates()
        {
            var list1 = new List<int> { 3 };
            var list2 = new List<string> { "3" };
            var merger = new SortedMerger().Add(list1).Add(list2);
            var result = merger.Merge();
            CollectionAssert.AreEqual(new List<int> { 3 }, result);
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_LargeInputs()
        {
            // Simulate large input
            int count = 1000;
            var list1 = new List<int>(Enumerable.Range(1, count));
            var list2 = new List<int>(Enumerable.Range(count + 1, count));
            var merger = new SortedMerger().Add(list1).Add(list2);
            var result = merger.Merge();
            Assert.IsTrue(result.Count == 2 * count);
        }
    }
}

But according to the problem statement, unit tests should cover bounding conditions. So these tests are a start.

Now, handling null or empty input lists:

In the Add method, if list is null, it's skipped. Also, if during conversion, any element cannot be converted to int (like passing a string "abc"), Convert.ToInt32 will throw an exception. The problem statement doesn't mention error handling, so we assume that all elements are valid.

Now, the code uses List.AddRange which is efficient for bulk addition.

The Merge method sorts the list in place and then deduplicates by checking adjacent elements, which works because after sorting, duplicates are consecutive.

But this approach has a time complexity of O(N log N) due to the sort step. For very large N (like 1e9), this might not be feasible, but given that .NET's List.Sort is optimized, it should handle large data sets as long as memory allows.

Now, what about performance optimizations for deduplication? The current approach creates a new list and iterates once, which is O(N) time. That's efficient.

But the problem says "handle large lists efficiently". So this code should be acceptable.

In conclusion, the solution involves creating a SortedMerger class with Add and Merge methods to allow fluent interface usage. The Add method converts all elements of each input list to integers and collects them. The Merge method sorts these integers and removes duplicates by checking consecutive values. Unit tests cover various cases including null/empty inputs, duplicates, and multiple lists.

<|end_of_thought|>

<|begin_of_solution|>

To solve this problem, we need to create an in-memory library that merges sorted lists of integers efficiently while removing any duplicates. The solution must handle large input lists and provide a fluent interface for easy chaining of operations.

### Approach
1. **Conversion**: Convert all elements from the input lists to integers.
2. **Collection**: Collect all converted integers into a single list.
3. **Sorting**: Sort the collected integers in ascending order.
4. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicates by iterating through the sorted list and checking adjacent elements.

The solution uses a fluent interface design pattern to allow method chaining, making it easy to add multiple lists before merging them. The `SortedMerger` class handles the addition of input lists and merges them using efficient sorting and deduplication techniques.

### Solution Code

```csharp
// File: SortedMerger.cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace MergingLibrary
{
    public class SortedMerger
    {
        private readonly List<int> _integers = new List<int>();

        public SortedMerger Add<T>(IEnumerable<T> list)
        {
            if (list == null) return this;
            var convertedList = list.Select(x => Convert.ToInt32(x)).ToList();
            _integers.AddRange(convertedList);
            return this;
        }

        public List<int> Merge()
        {
            // Sort the integers
            _integers.Sort();

            // Deduplicate by checking consecutive elements
            var result = new List<int>();
            int? previous = null;
            foreach (var current in _integers)
            {
                if (!previous.HasValue || current != previous.Value)
                {
                    result.Add(current);
                    previous = current;
                }
            }

            return result;
        }
    }
}
```

        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_LargeInputs()
        {
            int count = 1000;
            var list1 = new List<int>(Enumerable.Range(1, count));
            var list2 = new List<int>(Enumerable.Range(count + 1, count));
            var merger = new SortedMerger().Add(list1).Add(list2);
            var result = merger.Merge();

### Explanation
- **Fluent Interface**: The `SortedMerger` class allows adding multiple lists using the `Add` method and merging them with the `Merge` method, enabling easy chaining.
- **Efficient Conversion**: Elements from each input list are converted to integers in bulk using LINQ's `Select`, which is efficient for large datasets.
- **Sorting and Deduplication**: After sorting the collected integers, duplicates are removed by checking adjacent elements, ensuring an O(N) time complexity for deduplication.

This approach ensures that the solution handles large inputs efficiently while maintaining readability and ease of use through a fluent interface.
