**Library Structure and Implementation**

Given the comprehensive requirements for an X-BASE functionality library in .NET, let's break down the structure of the project and how we would start implementing it.

### Solution File Structure

The solution will contain multiple projects:

1. **XBaseCore**: Contains classes and interfaces for managing X-Base records (reading, writing), table management (creation, deletion), indexing, etc.
2. **XBaseQuery**: Handles SQL-like querying of X-Base records.
3. **XBaseSchemaManagement**: Deals with creating/altering/dropping schema elements such as tables, indexes, views, triggers, procedures, and functions.
4. **Tests**: Contains unit tests for all the functionalities provided by above projects.

### Getting Started

#### 1. Initialize New Solution:

Create a new .NET solution in Visual Studio 2022 targeting `.NET Standard 2.1` to ensure compatibility across different platforms.

```bash
dotnet new sln --name XBaseLibrary
```

#### 2. Create Projects

Within the `XBaseLibrary` solution folder, create projects for each of the components:

```bash
cd XBaseLibrary
dotnet new classlib -o XBaseCore
dotnet new classlib -o XBaseQuery
dotnet new classlib -o XBaseSchemaManagement
dotnet new mstest -o Tests

# Add all projects to the solution
dotnet sln add XBaseCore/XBaseCore.csproj 
dotnet sln add XBaseQuery/XBaseQuery.csproj 
dotnet sln add XBaseSchemaManagement/XBaseSchemaManagement.csproj 
dotnet sln add Tests/Tests.csproj 
```

#### 3. Coding Style Implementation

Follow the previously defined coding style guidelines for each of your files.

#### 4. **XBaseCore**

This project will contain the core functionalities to manage X-Base records. 

**Classes and Interfaces:**
- `IXBaseRecord`: An interface for dealing with individual X-Base records.
- `XBaseFileManager`: Manages reading/writing operations on X-Base files.
- `XBaseTableManager`: Manages tables creation, deletion, etc.

#### 5. **XBaseQuery**

This project will focus on SQL-like querying capabilities.

**Classes and Interfaces:**
- `IXBaseQueryExecutor`: Interface for executing queries against X-BASE database.
- `XBaseSqlParser`: Parses SQL-like commands into executable commands.
- `XBaseQueryProcessor`: Processes the parsed command to fetch data from the X-Base storage.

#### 6. **XBaseSchemaManagement**

This project handles schema management operations.

**Classes and Interfaces:**
- `ISchemaManager`: Interface for managing schema elements like tables, views, triggers, etc.
- Implementations for creating/deleting various schema components (e.g., `TableCreator`, `IndexManager`).

#### 7. **Tests**

Create unit tests for each component to ensure proper functionality.

**Sample Test Class:**
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class XBaseCoreTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void TestXBaseFileManager_ReadRecord()
    {
        // Arrange
        var fileManager = new XBaseFileManager(/* setup */);

        // Act
        var record = fileManager.ReadRecord(1);

        // Assert
        Assert.IsNotNull(record);
    }
}
```

### Documentation

Create a `README.md` in the root directory of your solution explaining the project structure, usage examples, and key points about each component.

```md
# XBaseLibrary

This library provides .NET classes for interacting with an X-BASE database-like system.

## Structure
- **XBaseCore** manages records.
- **XBaseQuery** handles SQL-like queries.
- **XBaseSchemaManagement** deals with schema elements (tables, views, etc.).
- **Tests** contains unit tests for the library.

## Usage

Detailed usage examples and API documentation can be found in each project's readme file or directly via generated XML documentation.

### Implementation Details 

Implement the core functionalities one by one, ensuring each step is thoroughly tested. Keep the design simple and modular, allowing easy expansion in the future. Use patterns such as Repositories for managing data access concerns, Facades for simplifying interactions with complex subsystems, and Builder patterns where appropriate.

After developing the core functionality, refine it through iterations based on feedback from unit tests and potential real-world usage scenarios.

### Conclusion 

Following these steps, you'll have a comprehensive library that provides X-BASE-like functionality in .NET. Remember to maintain clarity and simplicity throughout the design process, and don't hesitate to revisit your designs as new requirements or insights emerge during development.

By adhering strictly to coding standards, documenting thoroughly, and writing robust unit tests, you ensure that the library is not only functional but also maintainable and reliable for future enhancements and integrations.
