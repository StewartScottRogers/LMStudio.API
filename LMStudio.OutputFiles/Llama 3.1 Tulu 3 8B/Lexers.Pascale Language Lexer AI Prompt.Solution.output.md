Given the comprehensive requirements outlined above, let's outline a step-by-step approach to implementing this lexer for Pascale Language within a .NET 9.0 solution:

### Step 1: Solution Setup

**Solution Structure**:
- **PascaleLexer**: Class Library project containing all lexer logic.
- **PascaleAST**: Class Library project for handling Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **PascaleUnitTests**: Test Project containing unit tests.

In Visual Studio, create a new solution and add the three projects outlined above.

### Step 2: Lexer Implementation

**PascaleLexer Project**

1. **Create Token Classes**: For each token type defined by your grammar (e.g., `IdentifierToken`, `NumberToken`, etc.), define classes representing these tokens with properties for storing relevant information.

```csharp
public class IdentifierToken { public string Value; /* ... */ }
public class NumberToken { public double Value; /* ... */ }
// Add other token classes as needed
```

2. **Lexer Class**: Implement a lexer class (`PascaleLexer`) that reads input text and generates tokens.
   - Maintain a current position in the input text.
   - Define methods like `GetNextToken()` which analyzes the current character and emits the appropriate token.

```csharp
public class PascaleLexer
{
    private string sourceCode;
    private int currentPosition;

    public PascaleLexer(string sourceCode) => this.sourceCode = sourceCode;

    public Token GetNextToken() { /* Implement logic here */ }
}
```

3. **Tokenization Logic**: Write the `GetNextToken()` method to cover all lexer rules from your grammar.
   - Use regular expressions or manual string parsing based on your needs and performance considerations.

### Step 3: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation

**PascaleAST Project**

1. **AST Node Classes**: Define classes corresponding to each grammar rule, forming the nodes of your AST.
   - Each node class will have properties for its type, children (for composite nodes), and any relevant data.

```csharp
public abstract class AstNode { /* ... */ }
public class ProgramNode : AstNode { public List<DeclarationNode> Declarations; /* ... */ }
// Define other node classes corresponding to grammar rules
```

2. **AST Builder**: Implement an `AstBuilder` class that uses the tokens generated by the lexer to construct the AST.
   - This involves recursively building nodes based on token sequences.

### Step 4: Abstract Syntax Tree Pretty Printer

Implement a utility class or method that can traverse and print the AST in a readable format, akin to source code. 

```csharp
public static class AstPrettyPrinter
{
    public static void Print(AstNode node)
    {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Unit Testing

**PascaleUnitTests Project**

1. **Create Tests**: Write tests for different lexer scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
   - Use Microsoft's Unit Test Framework to create test methods.

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class LexerTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void TestSimpleProgram() { /* ... */ }

    // Add other test methods
}
```

2. **Run All Tests**: Ensure all lexer and AST construction functionality is tested extensively.

### Additional Notes:

- **Documentation**:
  - Comment thoroughly your code.
  - Write a README to explain the project structure, usage, and testing process.

- **Readability & Maintainability**:
  - Adhere strictly to the coding style guidelines provided.
  - Use records where appropriate for data immutability and simplicity.

This overview outlines a structured approach to implementing a lexer and AST generator in .NET for Pascale Language. Remember, each step involves detailed implementation depending on your specific requirements and performance considerations (e.g., using regular expressions vs manual parsing).

### Final Step

Before finalizing any part of the solution:

- **Review** each component for correctness.
- **Test** extensively, covering all lexer rules, AST generation cases, and edge conditions.
- **Optimize**, if necessary, based on profiling results.

Upon completing these steps, your solution should be comprehensive, well-documented, and ready to handle Pascale Language source code lexing and AST construction.
