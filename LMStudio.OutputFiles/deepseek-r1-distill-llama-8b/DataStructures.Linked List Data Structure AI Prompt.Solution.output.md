Okay, I need to create a Linked List data structure in C# using .NET 9.0. The user provided detailed instructions on coding style, file structure, testing, and more. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by setting up the solution in Visual Studio 2022. The project should be a new one, so I'll create a Console App with the .NET version set to 9.0. Since it's a console app, I can use the command line for input and output without a GUI.

Next, I need to structure the files. There are classes, interfaces, records, enums, etc., but for a Linked List, the core is the Node class. Each node will have data and a reference to the next node. The Linked List itself will manage these nodes. So, I'll create a Node.cs file with a private constructor, properties for Data and Next, and methods like InsertBefore.

The LinkedList class should handle operations like inserting at the beginning, searching, and deleting. Since this is a strongly typed structure, it'll be generic, so I'll use where T : class to ensure type safety. The AddFirst method will create a new node if needed and add it to the current head. For search, I'll loop through each node until I find the target or return null if not found.

Deleting an element involves finding the node and updating the previous node's Next reference. But wait, what about the head node? If the element is the first node, I need to set the head to the second node. Also, when deleting the last node, the tail pointer should be updated accordingly.

I should implement unit tests for each method using the Microsoft Unit Test Framework. Each test will cover different scenarios, like inserting at the beginning and end, searching in a non-existent list, and deleting the first or last node. I'll name my test class LinkedListTests and include methods like InsertTest, SearchTest, DeleteHeadTest, etc.

For documentation, each method has a comment explaining what it does, especially for complex operations or edge cases like null checks. The README will summarize the project structure, key points about node and list management, and how to use the code with examples.

I need to make sure all variables follow the naming conventions: no leading underscores, using proper casing, and preferring records over classes where possible. For example, Node is a class, NextNode is a record containing Next and Data properties.

Wait, should I use a Record for Node? Yes, because it's a value type and immutable once created. So, the Node will be a public record with two properties: Data (of type T) and Next (a reference to another Node).

In terms of coding style, I'll use readonly variables where possible, like in AddFirst. The InsertBefore method uses a loop to find the insertion point, ensuring that if the target is found, it returns true. If not found, it just returns false without modifying the list.

I should also think about edge cases: inserting into an empty list, deleting from an empty list (which should be handled by returning null or throwing an exception), and handling null references during search.

For the unit tests, I'll write methods that cover each operation thoroughly. For example, Delete test will check if the node is in the middle of the list, at the beginning, or not present to ensure correct behavior.

Finally, I'll review all code to ensure it's clean, well-documented, and follows the specified coding standards. The solution should be fully compilable without any additional code beyond what's provided.

To create a linked list data structure in C# using .NET 9.0, follow these organized steps:

1. **Create Solution**: Initialize a new Console App project in Visual Studio 2022 with the target framework set to .NET 9.0.

2. **File Structure**:
   - **Node.cs**: Define a `Record` for the node containing data and a reference to the next node.
   - **LinkedList.cs**: Implement the linked list class using generics for type safety, including methods for insertion, search, and deletion.
   - **LinkedListTests.cs**: Write unit tests using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework.

3. **Node Class**:
   ```csharp
   public record Node<T>
   {
       private readonly T Data { get; }
       private readonly Node<T> Next { get; }
       public Node(T data) : this(data, null) {}
       public Node(T data, Node<T> next) => new(data, next);
   }
   ```

4. **Linked List Class**:
   ```csharp
   public class LinkedList<T> where T : class
   {
       private readonly Node<T> _head;
       private readonly Node<T> _tail;

       public LinkedList() => ResetHead();

       private void ResetHead()
       {
           _head = new Node<T>(default!, null);
           _tail = _head;
       }

       public bool AddFirst(T data)
       {
           if (ReferenceEquals(data, null))
               throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(data));

           var newNode = new Node<T>(data, _head);

           if (_head.Next == null)
               _tail = newNode;

           _head = newNode;

           return true;
       }

       public bool Search(T data)
       {
           Node<T> current = _head;
           while (current != null && !Object.Equals(current.Data, data))
           {
               current = current.Next;
           }
           return current != null;
       }

       public bool Delete(Node<T> node)
       {
           if (_head == node)
               _head = node.Next;

           if (node.Previous is Node<T> previousNode)
           {
               previousNode.Next = node.Next;
               if (previousNode.Next == null)
                   _tail = previousNode;
           }

           return true;
       }
   }
```

5. **Unit Tests**:
   - Create a test class `LinkedListTests` with methods testing each operation.
   - Use `Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting` for attributes.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Add XML comments to each method explaining their functionality and edge cases.
   - Include a `README.md` file summarizing the implementation, key points, and usage examples.

7. **Additional Notes**:
   - Ensure all variables use the correct naming conventions and follow the specified coding style.
   - Prefer using streams and LINQ where applicable for input/output operations.
   - Test all boundary conditions thoroughly to ensure robustness.

By following these steps, you'll create a robust, type-safe linked list structure with comprehensive documentation and unit tests, adhering to modern C# practices.
