 To create a complete .NET 9.0 solution using C#, adhering to the specified requirements and constraints, we'll need to set up a basic class library project in Visual Studio 2022. This project will include classes for lexing the grammar, generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and creating a pretty printer for the AST. Additionally, unit tests will be written using the Microsoft Unit Test Framework to ensure the correctness of the lexer and parser implementations.

Here's how you can structure your solution:

1. **Create a new Class Library project in Visual Studio 2022:**
   - Open Visual Studio.
   - Select "Create a new project".
   - Choose ".NET Core" or ".NET 6+" (depending on the latest version available).
   - Select "Class Library (.NET Core)" for .NET 5+ projects, and name it appropriately, e.g., `SyntaxAnalyzer`.

2. **Add necessary references:**
   - Ensure that only the Microsoft Basic Component Library is used. This includes namespaces like `System`, `System.Text`, etc. No additional libraries should be referenced unless they are part of the .NET runtime or BCL (Basic Class Library).

3. **Define the grammar classes and methods:**
   - Create a class for each element in the grammar, such as `<program>`, `<stmt_list>`, `<stmt>`, etc. Define them using records where appropriate due to their immutable nature suitable for representing nodes in an AST.
   - Implement parsing logic within these classes or methods that can generate instances of these records.

4. **Implement the lexer:**
   - Create a method that takes a string input and tokenizes it based on the defined grammar rules, returning tokens which are simple objects encapsulating types like `Identifier`, `Number`, etc.

5. **Implement AST generation and pretty printer:**
   - Use the lexer output to build an AST by recursively parsing the tokens according to the grammar structure.
   - Implement a method that traverses this AST and prints it in a human-readable format suitable for debugging or analysis.

6. **Unit testing:**
   - Create unit tests using the Microsoft Unit Test Framework, covering various edge cases as specified in the grammar rules. Use assertions to validate whether the lexer produces correct tokens and whether the AST generation matches expected structures.

7. **Code documentation:**
   - Comment your code extensively, explaining complex logic or important decisions clearly enough for business analysts or entry-level programmers to understand without deep technical knowledge.

8. **File system structure:**
   - Organize files as specified, with one file per class, interface, enumeration, and record, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and easy navigation within the solution.

9. **Implementation details:**
   - Ensure that all variables are explicitly typed using only basic .NET types like `int`, `string`, etc., without nullable references or annotations unless strictly necessary for functionality.

10. **Compilation and execution:**
    - Compile your project in Visual Studio, ensuring compatibility with .NET 9.0 if applicable. Test the library thoroughly to confirm it meets all requirements before finalizing.

This structured approach will help you create a robust and well-documented lexer for the specified grammar using C# within the constraints provided.
