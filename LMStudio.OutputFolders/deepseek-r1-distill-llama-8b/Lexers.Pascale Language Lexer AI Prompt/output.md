Okay, I need to create a .NET 9.0 solution using C# in Visual Studio 2022 for a lexer that can parse the given grammar. The solution should be fully compilable and executable without additional coding. 

First, I'll outline the main components needed: a tokenizer, an abstract syntax tree (AST) generator, a pretty printer for the AST, and unit tests.

Starting with the Tokenizer, I'll define tokens like IDENTIFIER, NUMBER, STRING, etc. Using Microsoft's Basic Component Library, I can leverage built-in types and methods. I'll create a Token class to hold token values and positions. The tokenizer will iterate through the input string, identifying each token based on the grammar rules.

Next, the AST generation. Each token will be converted into an AST node. For example, an identifier becomes a VariableNode, a constant becomes a ConstantNode, and so on. I'll design abstract classes for different node types and implement specific subclasses as needed.

The Pretty Printer will traverse the AST and generate a formatted string. It should handle various node types, recursively printing child nodes with appropriate formatting.

Now, considering coding style, I'll ensure that all variables follow camelCase rules. I'll use records instead of classes where possible for better readability and performance. Each class, interface, record, and enumeration will be in separate files to keep the solution organized.

For unit testing, I'll use Microsoft's Unit Test Framework. I'll write tests for each token type and edge case scenarios, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the lexer's functionality.

I also need to handle error checking during tokenization. If a token doesn't match an expected type, the lexer should throw an exception with details about the position and expected token.

Finally, I'll structure the solution in Visual Studio, creating a new project for the lexer, AST, and tests. Each part will be a separate file or directory to maintain clarity and modularity.

# Solution Steps

1. **Initialize New Solution**
   - Create a new empty solution in Visual Studio 2022.
   
2. **Add Lexer Project**
   - Create a new C# project named "PascaleLexer".
   - Select .NET 9.0 as the target framework.

3. **Implement Token Class**
   - Create a `Token` class with properties for Value and Position.
   - Use value tuples to store token data efficiently.

4. **Define Tokens Enum**
   - Create an enum `TokenType` with values for each token type.

5. **Implement Lexer Logic**
   - Add a static method `Lex` that processes the input string.
   - Use a list to collect tokens and track current position.

6. **Add Exception Class**
   - Define a custom exception `LexerException` for error handling.

7. **Create Tokenizer Methods**
   - Implement methods to identify each token type (Identifier, Number, String, etc.).

8. **Build AST Classes**
   - Create abstract classes for different AST nodes (e.g., ProgramNode).
   - Define specific node classes like VariableNode, ConstantNode.

9. **Implement AST Generation**
   - Use the tokenizer's output to build the AST.
   - Handle nested structures and ensure correct tree hierarchy.

10. **Write Pretty Printer**
    - Create a `PrettyPrinter` class that traverses the AST.
    - Generate formatted strings based on node types.

11. **Add Unit Tests**
    - Create a test project using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework.
    - Write tests to validate tokenization and AST generation.

12. **Handle Error Cases**
    - Ensure lexer handles unexpected input gracefully with proper exceptions.

13. **Review and Refactor**
    - Check for any issues or optimizations in the code.
    - Ensure all tokens are correctly identified and AST nodes properly formed.

14. **Build Solution**
    - Compile all projects to ensure they work together seamlessly.

15. **Documentation**
    - Add comments explaining complex parts of the lexer and AST.
    - Include a README with overall project structure and usage instructions.

16. **Testing**
    - Run unit tests to verify functionality and edge cases.
    - Ensure the pretty printer outputs expected results.

17. **Final Checks**
    - Verify that all parts of the grammar are covered by tokens.
    - Confirm that the AST correctly represents the input structure.

18. **Deployment Considerations**
    - If needed, prepare a deployable package for future use.

19. **Review Code Style**
    - Ensure all coding guidelines are followed, especially naming conventions and formatting rules.

20. **Final Solution Review**
    - Summarize the solution's components and how they interconnect.
    - Verify that the solution meets all specified requirements and is maintainable.
