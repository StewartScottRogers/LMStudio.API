# Solution Steps
1. Initialize a new Solution in Visual Studio.
2. Define the project structure ensuring each class, interface, enumeration, and record is in its own file.
3. Write code using the described programming and styling guidelines.
4. Develop unit tests using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework to validate functionality, focusing on complex data input.
5. Include comprehensive comments for any non-trivial logic or structure to enhance understanding.

# Output Format
Deliver the solution as a Visual Studio project directory containing: 
- All necessary code files following the naming and file organization conventions.
- A README or documentation summarizing the project and key points of logic for easy comprehension.

# Notes
- The solution should be self-contained, adhering strictly to the guidelines provided.
- Assume that reasoning and clarity in naming conventions and comments is as important as functional correctness.
- The solution should be fully executable and compilable without any additional coding.
