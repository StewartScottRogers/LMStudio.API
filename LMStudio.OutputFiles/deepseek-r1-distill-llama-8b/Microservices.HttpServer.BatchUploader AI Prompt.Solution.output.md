Okay, so I need to create a .NET 9.0 solution that acts like an HTTP server accepting POST requests, saving the uploaded files to Azure Blob Storage with a unique timestamp. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the project structure. The user mentioned separate files for each class, interface, etc., so I'll start by creating a new solution in VS 2022. I'll need a few projects: one for the HTTP server, maybe an API, and another for unit tests. I'll use .NET 9.0, so I should make sure to select that in the project template.

Now, coding style is pretty specific. No leading underscores, explicit types, camelCase for member variables, etc. I need to be careful with naming conventions. Also, using records instead of classes where possible, and favoring tuples for returning multiple values. Oh, and streams for all I/O operations, so I'll have to handle the uploaded data as a stream.

For the server part, I think Microsoft's HttpServer library might help, but since it's minimal, maybe I can create a basic HTTP listener. Wait, in .NET 9, there's a new way to handle HTTP with the HttpListener class. So I'll set up an HttpListener and register it to listen on a specific port.

When a POST request comes in, I need to read the data. Using HttpListener.RequestEntity will give me the incoming data as a Stream. I can then process this stream, maybe reading it in chunks or all at once. But since it's an upload, it might be better to read it entirely into memory unless the files are huge.

Next, saving to Azure Blob Storage. I'll need the Azure.Storage.Blob namespace. I should retrieve the connection string from environment variables using ConfigurationBuilder. Then, create a unique filename with a timestamp. Maybe something like "uploads/{date-time}-{filename}". To get the date-time, I can use DateTime.Now.ToString() and format it to something like yyyyMMddHHmmss.

Wait, but how do I handle the uploaded file's name? The user sent a POST request, so the content-disposition might have the filename parameter. Or perhaps it's in the headers. I'll need to parse that correctly. Maybe using Request.Headers.GetValues("content-disposition") and then splitting the filename from there.

Alternatively, if the client sends the filename as part of the form data or multipart/form-data, I might need to extract it differently. But for simplicity, maybe assuming it's in the content-disposition header is okay.

Once I have the filename, I can construct the blob URI. Using BlobContainerClient.AppendToBlobAsync method. I'll create a new BlobItem with the constructed name and read the stream into it. Oh, but wait, streams can be big, so maybe using a memory stream to read all the data at once.

As for error handling, I should wrap everything in try-catch blocks. If something goes wrong reading the request or writing to the blob, I'll log an error and return a 500 status code with an appropriate message.

Unit testing is also crucial. I'll create unit tests using Microsoft's Test Framework. Testing the server's ability to handle POST requests, validate files, and correctly save them to blobs. Also, test edge cases like large files or invalid data formats.

In terms of structure, the HttpServer class will have a method to process uploads. It'll listen for POST requests, read the stream, parse the filename, and save it. The BlobUploader class will handle the actual writing to Azure Blob Storage, using the connection string and constructing the unique filename.

Documentation is important too. I'll include comments explaining each major part of the code, especially how the server handles requests and interacts with Azure Blob Storage. Also, a README file summarizing the project for easy understanding.

Wait, what about concurrency? If multiple requests come in at once, will the server handle them? Maybe using asynchronous methods or thread pool to handle simultaneous uploads. But since it's a basic implementation, perhaps handling one request at a time is sufficient for now.

Also, security: ensuring that only POST requests are allowed, and maybe setting a maximum file size limit. Or adding validation to check that the content type is multipart/related or form-data as expected.

I think I've covered the main points. Now, let me outline the steps:

1. Create solution in VS2022 with .NET 9.0.
2. Add HttpServer project using HttpListener.
3. Implement BlobUploader class to handle Azure storage.
4. Use ConfigurationBuilder for connection string.
5. Parse filename from request headers.
6. Save stream to blob with timestamped name.
7. Write unit tests covering all major functionalities and edge cases.
8. Ensure code adheres to the specified coding style, using records where possible and proper naming conventions.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, let me start coding each part step by step, making sure to follow all the guidelines carefully.

To create a minimal HTTP server in .NET 9.0 that accepts POST requests and saves uploaded files to Azure Blob Storage with unique timestamps, follow these steps:

### Solution Structure

1. **Create a New Solution**: Start by initializing a new solution in Visual Studio 2022 using the ".NET 9.0 - Windows" template.

2. **Add Projects**:
   - **HttpServerAPI**: A class library project for the HTTP server logic.
   - **BlobUploader**: Another class library for handling Azure Blob uploads.
   - **Tests**: A test project using Microsoft Unit Test Framework.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Project Structure and Configuration**:
   - Ensure each class, interface, etc., is in separate files.
   - Use `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` to read environment variables for Azure connection strings.

2. **HTTP Server Class** (`HttpServer.cs`):
   - Implement an `HttpListener` to handle POST requests on a specified port (e.g., 8080).
   - Use `RequestEntity` to receive incoming data as a stream.
   - Parse the filename from the request headers or form data.

3. **Blob Upload Handler** (`BlobUploader.cs`):
   - Use `Azure.Storage.Blob` to interact with Blob Storage.
   - Generate a unique filename using `DateTime.Now.ToString()` formatted as `yyyyMMddHHmmss`.
   - Construct the blob URI and upload the stream to Azure Blob Storage.

4. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write tests for handling POST requests, validating file uploads, and successful blob storage operations.
   - Cover edge cases like large files and invalid data formats.

### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Storage.Blob;

public record BlobUploadResponse
{
    public string?_blobContainer { get; init; }
    public string?_fileName { get; init; }
    public string?_uploadDate { get; init; }
}

public class HttpServer
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public HttpServer(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public async Task<BlobUploadResponse> ProcessUploadAsync(HttpRequest request)
    {
        if (request.Method != "POST")
            return new BlobUploadResponse { _uploadDate = DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyyMMddHHmmss"), _blobContainer = null, _fileName = null };

        var stream = await request.ReadAsStreamAsync();
        var fileName = GetFileName(request);
        var blobClient = new BlobClient(_configuration["BlobConnectionString"], _configuration["BlobContainerName"]);

        try
        {
            var blobItem = new BlobItem(fileName)
            {
                Data = stream
            };

            await blobClient.AppendToBlobAsync(blobItem);

            return new BlobUploadResponse { 
                _uploadDate = DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyyMMddHHmmss"), 
                _blobContainer = _configuration["BlobContainerName"], 
                _fileName = fileName 
            };
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Log error
            return new BlobUploadResponse { 
                _uploadDate = DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyyMMddHHmmss"), 
                _blobContainer = _configuration["BlobContainerName"], 
                _fileName = "error-" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".txt" 
            };
        }
    }

    private static string GetFileName(HttpRequest request)
    {
        var headers = request.Headers;
        var dispositionHeader = headers.GetValues("Content-Disposition");
        
        if (dispositionHeader == null) return "file.txt";
        
        string filename = dispositionHeader[0];
        filename = filename.Substring(0, filename.IndexOf('\'')) // Remove quotes
                           .Trim();
        
        return Path.GetFileName(filename);
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static async void Main()
    {
        var listener = new HttpListener();
        listener.Prefix = "*";
        listener.Port = 8080;
        listener.AutoForwardRewrite = false;

        listener.Start(() =>
        {
            var server = new HttpServer(new ConfigurationBuilder()
                .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
                .AddEnvironmentVariables());

            listener.RequestHandlers.Add("POST", (context) => 
            {
                context.Response.StatusCode = 200;
                string response = "File uploaded successfully.";
                context.Response.Content = response;
            });

            await server.ProcessUploadAsync(context.Request);
        });
    }
}
```

### Key Considerations

- **Versioning and Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are compatible with .NET 9.0.
- **Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions during file reading and storage.
- **Security**: Validate the content type of incoming requests and set reasonable limits for upload sizes.

This implementation provides a basic but functional HTTP server that efficiently handles POST requests and stores files in Azure Blob Storage with unique timestamps, adhering to the specified coding guidelines.
