Okay, so I need to create a linked list data structure in .NET using C# for my solution. Let me try to break down what I know and how to approach this.

First, a linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. It's dynamic because you can add or remove nodes easily, which changes the size of the list during runtime.

The user mentioned that I should create methods for inserting at the beginning, searching for an element, and deleting a node. So, I need to design a class, maybe called LinkedList, that will represent each node in the linked list.

Wait, but in .NET, there's already a LinkedList class in the System.Collections namespace. Hmm, maybe I should check if that's sufficient for what's needed here. But perhaps the task expects me to implement my own version regardless of the existing class.

Let me think about the structure of each node. Each node should have some data and a reference to the next node. So, I'll create a class Node with two properties: Value (the data) and Next (the link to the next node). Also, for better performance, adding Next as a LinkedList<Node> might be helpful.

Now, for the methods:

1. Insert at the beginning: This would involve creating a new node and setting its Next to the head of the list. Then update the head to this new node.
2. Search for an element: I'll need a method that takes an object as a parameter and returns true if it's found in the list, else false. To do this efficiently, maybe use a loop starting from the head, checking each node's Value until either a match is found or the end of the list is reached.
3. Delete a node: This could be a bit tricky. The method will need to know what value to delete and possibly where it is in the list. So, I'll have a method that takes an object as a parameter and traverses the list until it finds the node with that Value, then unlinks it by setting the previous node's Next to the next node.

But wait, how do I handle the case where the element isn't present? Maybe return false or throw an exception. The problem statement doesn't specify, but perhaps returning a boolean indicating success is better.

Let me sketch out the class structure:

- Class LinkedList: This will hold the head and tail references.
- Class Node: Each node with Value and Next.

Wait, maybe it's more efficient to use a doubly linked list so that deletion can be done without having to search for each node. But I think for simplicity, a singly linked list is sufficient unless specified otherwise.

Another point: in C#, using var might help in making the code concise, especially with Tuples as per the coding style guide.

Also, considering the coding style guidelines:

- No leading underscores.
- Explicit types.
- camelCase for variables and methods.
- Properties, methods, etc., use UpperCamelCase.

So, my Node class would be something like this:

public class Node
{
    public object Value { get; set; }
    public LinkedList<Node> Next { get; set; }
}

Then the LinkedList class:

public class LinkedList
{
    private Node head;
    private Node tail;

    public bool InsertAtBeginning(object value)
    {
        // Create new node
        var newNode = new Node(value);
        if (head == null)
        {
            head = newNode;
            tail = newNode;
        }
        else
        {
            newNode.Next = head;
            head = newNode;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public bool Search(object value)
    {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null)
        {
            if (current.Value == value)
                return true;
            current = current.Next;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public bool DeleteNode(object value)
    {
        // First, find the node to delete
        Node current = head;
        Node prevNode = null;
        while (current != null && current.Value != value)
        {
            prevNode = current;
            current = current.Next;
        }
        if (current == null) return false; // Not found

        // Unlink the node
        if (prevNode == null)
        {
            head = current.Next;
            tail = head;
        }
        else
        {
            prevNode.Next = current.Next;
            if (current.Next == null)
                tail = prevNode;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

Wait, but in the coding style guide, it says to use var for Tuples and favor Records over Classes. So perhaps I should create a record instead of a class for Node.

Yes, that makes sense. So, let me define Node as a record:

public record Node
{
    public object Value { get; set; }
    public LinkedList<Node> Next { get; set; }
}

But wait, in C#, records can't have properties with backing fields, but I think it's okay here since we're using properties directly.

Then, the LinkedList class would be:

public class LinkedList
{
    private Node head;
    private Node tail;

    public bool InsertAtBeginning(object value)
    {
        var newNode = new Node(value);
        if (head == null)
        {
            head = newNode;
            tail = newNode;
        }
        else
        {
            newNode.Next = head;
            head = newNode;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public bool Search(object value)
    {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null && current.Value != value)
        {
            current = current.Next;
        }
        return current != null;
    }

    public bool DeleteNode(object value)
    {
        Node current = head;
        Node prevNode = null;
        while (current != null && current.Value != value)
        {
            prevNode = current;
            current = current.Next;
        }
        if (current == null) return false;

        // Unlink the node
        if (prevNode == null)
        {
            head = current.Next;
            tail = head;
        }
        else
        {
            prevNode.Next = current.Next;
            if (current.Next == null)
                tail = prevNode;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

Hmm, but the problem statement says to use only the Microsoft Basic Component Library. So perhaps using System.Collections is allowed since it's part of the basic libraries.

Wait, no, System.Collections is in Microsoft.BasicComponentLibrary. So that's fine.

Now, considering unit testing: I need to write tests for each method. Using Microsoft Unit Test Framework, as per instructions.

So, I'll create a test project and write tests for InsertAtBeginning, Search, DeleteNode.

For example:

using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace LinkedListTests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class LinkedListTests
    {
        private LinkedList list = new LinkedList();

        [TestMethod]
        public void TestInsertAtBeginning()
        {
            bool success = list.InsertAtBeginning(5);
            Assert.IsTrue(success, "Failed to insert at beginning");
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void TestSearchExistingElement()
        {
            list.InsertAtBeginning(3);
            list.InsertAtBeginning(4);
            list.InsertAtBeginning(5);

            bool found = list.Search(5);
            Assert.IsTrue(found, "Should find existing element");
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void TestDeleteNode()
        {
            list.InsertAtBeginning(1);
            list.InsertAtBeginning(2);
            list.InsertAtBeginning(3);

            bool deletedThree = list.DeleteNode(3);
            Assert.IsTrue(deletedThree, "Failed to delete node");

            // Check if the list is now modified
            Assert.AreEqual(2 nodes, list.Count); // Wait, I don't have a Count method yet.

Wait, I realize that in my current implementation, there's no way to get the count of nodes. So perhaps adding a helper method to calculate the length would be useful.

So adding:

public int Length()
{
    Node current = head;
    int count = 0;
    while (current != null)
    {
        count++;
        current = current.Next;
    }
    return count;
}

And in the test, I can use this method.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to have a Count property that updates as nodes are added or removed. But perhaps for simplicity, just add a Length() method for testing purposes.

So updating the tests:

[TestMethod]
public void TestDeleteNode()
{
    list.InsertAtBeginning(1);
    list.InsertAtBeginning(2);
    list.InsertAtBeginning(3);

    bool deletedThree = list.DeleteNode(3);
    Assert.IsTrue(deletedThree, "Failed to delete node");

    int count = list.Length();
    Assert.AreEqual(2, count, "List should have 2 nodes after deletion");
}

But wait, in C#, I can't have a method named 'Count' with the same name as an existing method. So perhaps naming it Length() is appropriate.

Wait, another thing: In the coding style guide, it says to use readonly on variables whenever possible. So perhaps I should make head and tail readonly private fields.

Yes, that's better for immutability.

So:

private readonly Node head;
private readonly Node tail;

Then, in the InsertAtBeginning method, since we can't modify head and tail in a way that breaks their referential integrity, it's okay to assign them as before.

Now, considering all these points, I think my solution is solid. But let me double-check each part.

- The Node record uses UpperCamelCase for its properties.
- LinkedList class has private readonly fields.
- All methods are named appropriately with UpperCamelCase.
- InsertAtBeginning, Search, DeleteNode all follow the method naming guidelines.
- I used var where possible, though in this case, it's not necessary since the types are explicit.
- The code uses LINQ and streams? Hmm, no, because linked lists are more about sequential access. So perhaps using foreach loops is better as per the guidelines.

Wait, the programming constructs mention favoring 'foreach' instead of 'for' loops. So in my Search method, I used a while loop. Maybe converting that to a foreach is possible but might not be necessary since it's a simple iteration. Alternatively, maybe using a stream could work, but for a linked list, it's more natural to use a loop.

In any case, the current implementation seems correct and follows the guidelines provided.

I also added unit tests, which cover the main functionalities: inserting at the beginning, searching, deleting a node. Each test checks for success and the expected outcome, like the length of the list after deletion.

Additionally, I considered adding helper methods like Length() to aid in testing without overcomplicating the main class.

So, putting it all together, this should satisfy the requirements outlined.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to implement a linked list data structure with specific operations: inserting an element at the beginning, searching for an element, and deleting an element. The solution will be developed in C# using .NET 9.0 and will follow specific coding guidelines to ensure clarity and maintainability.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure Design**: We will create a `LinkedList` class that simulates a singly linked list. Each node in the list will contain a value and a reference (link) to the next node.
2. **Node Class**: The nodes will be defined using a record for immutability, with properties for the value and the next link.
3. **Insert Operation**: Inserting an element at the beginning involves creating a new node and updating the head reference of the linked list.
4. **Search Operation**: Searching for an element requires traversing the list starting from the head until either the target value is found or the end of the list is reached.
5. **Delete Operation**: Deleting a node involves finding the node by value, then adjusting the links to remove it from the list.
6. **Unit Testing**: We will include unit tests using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework to ensure each operation works as expected.

### Solution Code
```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace LinkedListSolution
{
    public class LinkedList
    {
        private readonly Node head;
        private readonly Node tail;

        public bool InsertAtBeginning(object value)
        {
            var newNode = new Node(value);
            if (head == null)
            {
                head = newNode;
                tail = newNode;
            }
            else
            {
                newNode.Next = head;
                head = newNode;
            }
            return true;
        }

        public bool Search(object value)
        {
            Node current = head;
            while (current != null && current.Value != value)
            {
                current = current.Next;
            }
            return current != null;
        }

        public bool DeleteNode(object value)
        {
            Node current = head;
            Node prevNode = null;
            while (current != null && current.Value != value)
            {
                prevNode = current;
                current = current.Next;
            }
            if (current == null) return false;

            if (prevNode == null)
            {
                head = current.Next;
                tail = head;
            }
            else
            {
                prevNode.Next = current.Next;
                if (current.Next == null)
                    tail = prevNode;
            }
            return true;
        }

        public int Length()
        {
            Node current = head;
            int count = 0;
            while (current != null)
            {
                count++;
                current = current.Next;
            }
            return count;
        }
    }

    public record Node
    {
        public object Value { get; set; }
        public LinkedList<Node> Next { get; set; }
    }

    [TestClass]
    public class LinkedListTests
    {
        private readonly LinkedList list = new LinkedList();

        [TestMethod]
        public void TestInsertAtBeginning()
        {
            bool success = list.InsertAtBeginning(5);
            Assert.IsTrue(success, "Failed to insert at beginning");
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void TestSearchExistingElement()
        {
            list.InsertAtBeginning(3);
            list.InsertAtBeginning(4);
            list.InsertAtBeginning(5);

            bool found = list.Search(5);
            Assert.IsTrue(found, "Should find existing element");
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void TestDeleteNode()
        {
            list.InsertAtBeginning(1);
            list.InsertAtBeginning(2);
            list.InsertAtBeginning(3);

            bool deletedThree = list.DeleteNode(3);
            Assert.IsTrue(deletedThree, "Failed to delete node");

            int count = list.Length();
            Assert.AreEqual(2, count, "List should have 2 nodes after deletion");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Data Structure**: The `LinkedList` class uses two private fields, `head` and `tail`, to keep track of the start and end of the linked list. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node.
- **Insert Operation**: The `InsertAtBeginning` method creates a new node and links it at the beginning of the list. If the list is empty, both `head` and `tail` are updated; otherwise, only `head` is updated.
- **Search Operation**: The `Search` method traverses each node starting from `head`. It returns true if the value is found, false otherwise.
- **Delete Operation**: The `DeleteNode` method searches for the node by value. If found, it adjusts the links of the previous and next nodes to remove the target node.
- **Length Method**: This helper method calculates the number of nodes in the list by iterating from the head to the tail.

The unit tests ensure that each operation works correctly by checking if values are inserted, searched for, and deleted as expected. This approach ensures the linked list operations are efficient and meet the specified requirements.
