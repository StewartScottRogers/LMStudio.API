// Example: 
public static (int, string) GetDimensions() => ("10", "ten");

But then we need to name it as:
  - Returning multiple values? Let's create a record or a class.

I think I should not overcomplicate. Since the prompt says never leading underscores and no implicit usings.

Let me start by creating:

- PartInventory.cs (Part number, Name)
- A method that returns var type tuple must be Post Fixed with 'Tuple'.

But let's stop for now and assume we need a complete solution. 

I'll create a class named PartNumberInfo, which is an enum or something? No, the requirements say to use records.

We are favoring records over classes when possible, so:

public record PartInventory : IPartRecord { ... }

But wait: "Favor Records over Classes". So let's use Record or readonly struct?

Wait, we are using .NET 9.0 and Visual Studio 2022. 

**Final Approach**: 
Since no requirements were provided for the application itself, I'll create a simple parts inventory management system that can:

1. Add part details to the inventory.
2. Remove part by part number.

The solution must be fully compilable in Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 9.0.

We are only allowed Microsoft Basic Component Library? So use System.Collections.Generic, etc.

Let's create a console application that uses:

- A class for Part (record or record)
- But the prompt says "Favor Records over Classes" but also "Favor Tuples", so we can do both?

Wait: Favor Tuples when returning multiple values. 

But note: The requirement is to use Post Fixed with 'Tuple' and var type.

I think I should create a complete .NET 9.0 Solution with the following:

- One console application project.
- Use Microsoft Unit Test Framework for testing.

We'll have:
- Part class (to represent parts) as record or class? Let's use Record since it's named from the method and Post Fixed.

But wait, we are to create separate files for each class. 

Wait, let me define:

**Solution Structure:**
  - Solution name: InventoryManagement
  - Project: PartsInventorySystem

Create a complete .NET 9.0 solution with:
   * The ability to add parts from the command line.
   - Each part has a PartNumber and Description.

But note: 
  - Use var types for Tuples (but only for Tuple) 

I'll create a simple application that:
1. Adds parts to inventory
2. Removes parts by number or name.
3. List all parts, etc.

**Solution Structure**:

We have two files: one for the main app and unit tests.

But without knowing what the business logic is, I can only provide an example. 

Since you requested a complete .NET 9.0 Solution usable in Visual Studio 2022, here's a sample application that demonstrates these rules.
</think>
I'll create a simple console application for managing inventory parts using a record to demonstrate C# coding standards and unit testing with Microsoft Unit Test Framework.

**Solution Name**: InventoryManagementSystem

We are going to implement:
- A solution for .NET 9.0 (so target framework net9.0)
- A complete, compilable, executable solution in Visual Studio 2022.
- Use only Basic Component Library and C# with explicit types.
