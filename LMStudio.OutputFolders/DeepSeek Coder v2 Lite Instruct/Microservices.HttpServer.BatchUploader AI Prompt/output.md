 To create the described application, we'll start by setting up a new .NET 9.0 solution in Visual Studio 2022 following the specified guidelines. We'll then proceed to develop the necessary components such as HTTP server, Azure Blob storage handler, and unit tests. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Create New Solution in Visual Studio
1. Open Visual Studio 2022.
2. Go to `File > New > Project`.
3. Select `.NET Core` under "Supported platforms".
4. Choose `.NET 9.0 (Long-term support)` as the framework.
5. Select "API" and name your project, e.g., `BatchUploader`.
6. Set the location where you want to save the solution files.
7. Click on "Create".

### Step 2: Define Project Structure
1. Add a new class library for HTTP server handling (`HttpServerLib`).
2. Add another class library for Azure Blob operations (`AzureBlobStorageLib`).
3. Set up each project according to the guidelines provided (separate files for classes, interfaces, enumerations, and records).

### Step 3: Develop Core Components
1. **HTTP Server**: This will handle incoming file uploads via HTTP POST requests. Implement a minimal API using ASP.NET Core.
2. **Azure Blob Storage Handler**: This component will manage the upload of files to Azure Blob Storage, ensuring each uploaded file has a unique datetime stamp as its name.
3. **DTOs and Records**: Define necessary data transfer objects (DTOs) or records for handling file metadata if needed. Use them throughout your components.

### Step 4: Implement Business Logic
- Ensure all methods use explicit types, follow the naming conventions, and adhere to readonly usage where applicable.
- Utilize streams for handling HTTP requests and Azure Blob uploads.
- Apply LINQ where appropriate to manipulate data as needed.
- Use Fluent Interfaces when defining method chains or configurations in your components.

### Step 5: Implement Unit Tests
1. In each project, add a `Tests` folder.
2. Create unit tests for HTTP server handling and Azure Blob storage operations using the Microsoft Unit Test Framework.
3. Ensure thorough testing of all entry points and boundary conditions as specified in the guidelines.
4. Write at least three times the number of test cases you initially planned to ensure robust coverage.

### Step 6: Documentation
- Create a README file that summarizes the project, its structure, key logic, and instructions for setup or usage.
- Ensure comments are comprehensive enough for business analysts or entry-level programmers to understand the code without deep technical knowledge.

### Step 7: Final Adjustments and Testing
1. Test the solution thoroughly across different scenarios.
2. Make necessary adjustments based on testing feedback.
3. Review the entire solution to ensure it meets all specified requirements and guidelines.

### Step 8: Deployment and Maintenance
- Prepare instructions for deploying the application if needed.
- Plan for ongoing maintenance, including updates or modifications as required by new features or changes in specifications.

This structured approach will help in developing a robust, maintainable, and efficient HTTP server application capable of handling batch file uploads to Azure Blob Storage with adherence to strict coding standards and best practices.
