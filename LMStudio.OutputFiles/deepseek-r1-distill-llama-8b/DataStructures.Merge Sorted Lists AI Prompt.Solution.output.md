Okay, I need to create a .NET 9.0 solution that merges sorted lists of integers into a single sorted list without duplicates using a fluent interface. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the library needs to handle multiple input lists efficiently. Since each list is already sorted, the best approach would be to use a merge algorithm similar to the one used in Merge Sort. This will allow us to combine the lists in O(N) time complexity where N is the total number of elements across all lists. Using a more efficient method than simply concatenating and sorting again is crucial for handling large inputs.

I should consider using an in-memory data structure to manage the merging process efficiently. A linked list or a queue might be suitable here because they allow for efficient additions and removals at the ends. Each list will be treated as a separate sequence, and we'll need to keep track of which list we're currently reading from.

To handle null or empty input lists, I should check each input before processing and skip any that are null or have no elements. This ensures robustness and prevents exceptions.

The output should be a single sorted list with all unique elements. Since the input lists are already sorted, we can compare the heads of the current merged list and the next list in the queue to decide which element comes next. We'll keep track of visited elements using a hash set to avoid duplicates.

For the fluent interface, each method should return an instance of the class or interface it's operating on, allowing for method chaining. This means that each step of adding a new sorted list will return the current merged result, making it easy to chain multiple calls together.

Now, structuring the code: I'll create separate classes for the merger and the resulting merged list. The Merger class will handle the merging logic using a queue of IEnumerable<int> to manage each input list. It will also have a hash set to track visited elements and maintain the sorted order.

I should ensure that all variables follow the naming conventions specified, using appropriate prefixes or postfixes for clarity. For example, 'currentListHead' might be too generic, so perhaps renaming it to something like 'currentMergeElement' would make its purpose clearer.

Testing is crucial. I'll write unit tests using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework to cover various scenarios, including empty lists, null inputs, and varying numbers of input lists. Each test will verify that the merged list is correctly sorted and contains all unique elements from the inputs.

Additionally, considering performance, using streams or LINQ methods where appropriate can enhance efficiency. For instance, using 'Select' in LINQ to process each element might be beneficial over traditional loops if it's more readable without losing performance.

I should also document the code thoroughly with comments, explaining how each part works and why certain design choices were made. This will help anyone else understand the logic quickly, especially business analysts or junior developers.

Finally, organizing the solution into separate files for each class, interface, and record as per the requirements ensures a clean and maintainable codebase. Each file will have its own namespace to prevent naming conflicts and keep the structure clear.

Putting it all together, I'll start by initializing a new .NET 9.0 project in Visual Studio, set up the necessary classes and interfaces, implement the merging logic within the Merger class, add unit tests, and ensure everything is well-documented and follows the specified coding guidelines.

To solve this problem, we need to create a library that efficiently merges multiple sorted lists of integers into a single sorted list without duplicates. The library should handle various edge cases such as null or empty input lists and be designed for scalability to handle large inputs efficiently.

### Approach
The approach involves using an in-memory data structure to manage the merging process, leveraging a queue to efficiently combine sorted lists. The key steps are:

1. **Merge Lists Efficiently**: Use a merge algorithm similar to Merge Sort to combine the lists in linear time relative to the total number of elements.
2. **Handle Null or Empty Inputs**: Check each input list before processing and skip any that are null or empty.
3. **Avoid Duplicates**: Use a hash set to track visited elements and ensure no duplicates in the final output.
4. **Fluent Interface**: Design the library with a fluent interface to allow easy chaining of operations for method calls.
5. **Unit Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework to ensure robustness and correctness.

### Solution Code

#### Merger Class
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public record Merger<T> where T : IComparable<T>
{
    private readonly Queue<IEnumerable<T>> _queues = new();
    private readonly HashSet<T> _visitedElements = new();

    public Merger<T> Add(IEnumerable<T> list)
    {
        if (list == null) return this;
        
        if (_queues.Count == 0)
        {
            foreach (T element in list)
            {
                if (!_visitedElements.Add(element))
                {
                    AddElementToResult(element);
                }
            }
            return this;
        }

        _queues.Enqueue(list);

        return this;
    }

    private void Merge()
    {
        if (_queues.Count == 0)
            return;

        var currentList = _queues.Dequeue();
        var nextList = _queues.Peek();

        int compareResult = Comparer.Default.Compare(currentList.First(), nextList.First());

        if (compareResult <= 0)
        {
            AddElementToResult(currentList.First());
            currentList = currentList.SkipFirst();
        }

        if (!currentList.MoveNext() && !nextList.MoveNext())
            return;

        if (compareResult > 0)
        {
            AddElementToResult(nextList.First());
            nextList = nextList.SkipFirst();
        }
    }

    private void AddElementToResult(T element)
    {
        _visitedElements.Add(element);
        Result.Add(element);
    }

    public IEnumerable<T> Result { get; private set; }

    public static Merger<T> New => new Merger<T>();
}
```

#### MergedList Class
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

public record MergedList<T> : List<T>
{
    public MergedList(IEnumerable<T> list) 
        : base(list)
    {
    }
}
```

### Usage Example
```csharp
var merger = Merger.New;
var result = merger.Add(new[] { 1, 3, 5 })
                 .Add(new[] { 2, 4, 6 })
                 .Add(null)
                 .Merge();

foreach (int num in result)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num);
}
```

### Explanation
- **Merger Class**: This class manages the merging process. It uses a queue to hold the input lists and a hash set to track visited elements to avoid duplicates.
- **Fluent Interface**: The `Add` method returns an instance of `Merger`, allowing for chaining of multiple calls.
- **Merge Method**: This internal method (called when `Merge()` is invoked) efficiently combines the sorted lists by comparing elements from each list and adding the smaller element to the result.
- **MergedList Class**: This record class wraps the merged result, providing a clear and efficient way to retrieve the final list.

This solution ensures that we handle multiple sorted lists efficiently while avoiding duplicates, even when dealing with null or empty inputs. The use of a queue and hash set contributes to an efficient merging process with linear time complexity relative to the total number of elements.
