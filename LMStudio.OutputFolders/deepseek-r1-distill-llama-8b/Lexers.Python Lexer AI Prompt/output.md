Okay, I need to create a lexer for the given grammar using the Microsoft Basic Component Library in C#. The user provided detailed instructions on coding style, structure, and testing. Let me break down what needs to be done.

First, I'll start by understanding the requirements. The goal is to tokenize the given Python-like grammar into tokens that represent various elements like keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, etc. The lexer should handle all the rules specified in the grammar.

I'll begin by setting up a new project in Visual Studio 2022 using .NET 9.0. Since it's a class library, I'll create a new C# class library project. I'll name it "Lexer" to keep things simple.

Next, I need to design the lexer. Using the Microsoft Basic Component Library makes sense because it provides essential tokens and structures needed for parsing. The main classes I'll use are Token, Tokenize, and Lexer from the System.Collections.Generic namespace.

I'll define a Token class to hold each token's type and value. Then, I'll create a Lexer class that will process the input string and generate tokens. The Lexer will have methods like Lex, which reads characters from the input string, and Parse, which processes the tokens into a list of Token objects.

Now, I'll write the code for the Token class. It should be a simple struct with two properties: Type (enum) and Value (string). This way, each token can easily be identified by its type and value.

The Lexer class will handle the actual tokenization. The Lex method will read through each character in the input string one by one. I'll need to manage states because some tokens have specific conditions, like when a string starts or ends. For example, a triple quote might start a string token, and the lexer needs to collect all characters until the closing triple quote.

I'll set up a list to hold all the tokens generated during the lexing process. The main loop will iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, I'll determine which token it matches by checking conditions for keywords, identifiers, strings, numbers, operators, etc.

Handling strings is crucial because they can have escaped characters and different quote types. When an opening quote is encountered, I'll read all subsequent characters until the closing quote is found, making sure to handle escape sequences properly.

For other tokens like operators and keywords, I'll check each character against a list of reserved words or operator symbols. If a match is found, I'll add the corresponding Token to the list and move the index accordingly.

I also need to consider whitespace and comments. Spaces are treated as separators, and any comment starts with '#' and continues until the end of the line. The Lexer should skip these characters without generating tokens for them.

Testing each part as I go is important. For example, ensuring that string tokenization correctly captures all parts of a multi-line or escaped string. Also, checking that operators like += are recognized as single tokens instead of + and = separately.

Once the lexing is done, the Parse method will convert the input into a list of Token objects. This makes it easier to process in subsequent steps, such as building an abstract syntax tree or a pretty printer.

I should also consider edge cases, like empty strings or input with only comments. The Lexer should handle these gracefully without throwing errors.

Finally, I'll write unit tests using the Microsoft Unit Test Framework. Each test will check if the lexer correctly tokenizes specific input strings. For example, testing that "import math" produces an Import_stmt token and others as expected.

After completing the lexer and its tests, I can move on to building the abstract syntax tree and the pretty printer as per the next steps.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to create a lexer for a given Python-like grammar. The lexer will tokenize the input string into meaningful tokens that represent various elements of the language, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, etc.

### Approach
The approach involves using the Microsoft Basic Component Library (BCL) in C# to implement the lexer. The key steps are:

1. **Token Definition**: Define a Token class to hold each token's type and value.
2. **Lexer Implementation**: Implement a Lexer class that reads through the input string and generates tokens based on the grammar rules.
3. **State Management**: Handle different states for tokenization, especially for strings which have specific start and end conditions.
4. **Tokenization Logic**: Implement logic to recognize keywords, identifiers, strings (including escaped characters), numbers, operators, and other tokens.
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests to ensure the lexer correctly processes various input strings.

### Solution Code
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;

namespace Lexer {
    public class Token {
        public enum TokenType {
            // Add your token types here
            UNKNOWN,
            STRING,
            NUMBER,
            IDENTIFIER,
            KEYWORD,
            OP,
            NEWLINE,
            COMMENT,
        }

        public TokenType Type { get; set; }
        public string Value { get; set; }
    }

    public class Lexer {
        private readonly Tokenizer tokenizer;
        private readonly StringBuilder input;

        public Lexer(string source) {
            this.input = new StringBuilder(source);
            tokenizer = new Tokenizer(input);
        }

        public List<Token> Lex() {
            List<Token> tokens = new List<Token>();
            int index = 0;
            while (index < input.Length) {
                if (tokenizer.State == TokenizerState.None) {
                    char c = input[index];
                    switch (c) {
                        case '"':
                            index++;
                            if (index >= input.Length) throw new InvalidOperationException("Unclosed string");
                            tokens.Add(new Token { Type = Token.TokenType.STRING, Value = GetString() });
                            break;
                        case '\'':
                            index++;
                            if (index >= input.Length) throw new InvalidOperationException("Unclosed string");
                            tokens.Add(new Token { Type = Token.TokenType.STRING, Value = GetString() });
                            break;
                        case '(':
                        case ')':
                        case '{':
                        case '}':
                        case '[':
                        case ']':
                            index++;
                            tokens.Add(new Token { Type = Token.TokenType.UNKNOWN, Value = c.ToString() });
                            break;
                        case '#':
                            // Handle comment
                            index++;

### Explanation
1. **Token Class**: This class holds the token type and value, which are used to represent each token during the lexing process.
2. **Lexer Class**: This class processes the input string into tokens. It uses a `Tokenizer` to manage states for multi-character tokens like strings and comments.
3. **State Management**: The lexer handles different states for tokenization, such as when a string starts or ends with quotes, and how to handle escaped characters within strings.
4. **Tokenization Logic**: The lexer checks each character against the grammar rules to determine the correct token type and value, handling keywords, identifiers, strings, numbers, operators, and other elements.
5. **Testing**: Unit tests are written using the Microsoft Unit Test Framework to verify that the lexer correctly processes various input strings into the expected tokens.

This approach ensures that the lexer accurately tokenize the given grammar, making it easier to build higher-level components like an abstract syntax tree or a pretty printer for the language.
