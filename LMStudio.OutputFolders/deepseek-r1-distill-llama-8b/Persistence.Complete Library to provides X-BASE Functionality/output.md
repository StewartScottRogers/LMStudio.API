Alright, I need to create a .NET 9.0 solution that provides X-BASE functionality using C#. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, the solution should include a comprehensive set of features for interacting with X-BASE records. That includes CRUD operations and more advanced functionalities like creating tables, indexes, relationships, etc. I'll need to structure this into separate classes for each component.

I remember the coding style guidelines mention using UpperCamelCase for class names, so I'll name my main classes like DatabaseManager, TableManager, RecordManager, etc. Also, all variables should follow camel case, but without leading underscores. Properties and methods will use UpperCamelCase as well.

For file structure, each class, interface, enumeration, and record needs its own file. So I'll create files like DatabaseManager.cs, TableSchema.cs, XBaseRecord.cs, etc. Interfaces like IDataAccess, ITableDefinition, IQueryExecutor should be in separate interface files.

Now, thinking about the database engine. Since X-BASE isn't a real database, I can simulate it using something like SQLite. That way, I can handle file operations and create tables on disk. The DatabaseManager will handle connecting to databases and managing schemas.

The TableManager will deal with creating, deleting, and retrieving table structures. Each table's schema can be defined in a TableSchema class, which includes columns and their data types. For example, a Column struct will hold the name and DataType.

Handling SQL-like queries is crucial. I'll create a QueryBuilder class to parse query strings into something executable by the database. It should support basic clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc. Then, an IQueryExecutor interface will execute these queries against my simulated database.

When it comes to handling records, the RecordManager class will manage CRUD operations. Each record's data can be stored in memory using a Dictionary<string, object> where the key is the primary key. Methods like GetRecord and UpdateRecord will interact with the database.

Indexes are important for performance, so IndexManager will handle their creation and deletion. A simple index structure, maybe a list of tuples containing the column name and order, should suffice for now.

Relationships between tables can be managed by the RelationshipManager. Each relationship can define the foreign key and the related table's primary key. This will allow for joins in queries.

Stored procedures and triggers require some execution time. I'll define these as classes that implement specific interfaces. For example, a StoredProcedure will have parameters and a name, while a Trigger will specify the owning table and an OnUpdate or OnInsert action.

The documentation is important for clarity. Each class will have XML comments explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values. Unit tests will be written using Microsoft's Test framework to cover all major functionalities.

I need to ensure that all code uses var where possible, especially for tuples which should end with 'Tuple'. Records will use a Record type, so I'll define a base class XBaseRecord with properties like Id, Name, etc., and override required fields in derived records.

Finally, the solution needs to be fully compilable. I'll structure it into several projects: a core library and test project. Using NuGet packages for SQLite will help with file operations.

I should also think about error handling, maybe adding try-catch blocks in methods and returning appropriate exceptions. Testing each component thoroughly is essential to ensure the solution works as intended.

To create a .NET 9.0 solution that provides X-BASE functionality, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Initialize the Solution
Create a new solution in Visual Studio 2022. We will structure it into several projects:
- **XBase.Core**: Core library providing database operations.
- **XBase.Tests**: Unit tests for the core library.

### Step 2: Define Coding Style and Structure
Adhere to the specified coding style guidelines, ensuring all variables, classes, and methods follow camel case conventions. Use Records instead of traditional classes where possible.

### Step 3: Develop Core Components
1. **DatabaseManager**: Handles database connections and schema management.
2. **TableManager**: Manages table creation, deletion, and schema definitions.
3. **RecordManager**: Implements CRUD operations for records.
4. **QueryBuilder**: Builds SQL-like queries.
5. **IQueryExecutor**: Executes queries against the simulated database.

### Step 4: Implement SQL-Like Queries
Create a parser to convert string queries into executable code. Use ADO.NET Core for query execution, simulating interactions with SQLite.

### Step 5: Manage Records and Tables
Define record structures using Records instead of classes. The RecordManager will interact with the database to read and write records based on their primary keys.

### Step 6: Add Advanced Features
Implement IndexManager, RelationshipManager, TriggerManager, and ProcedureManager to handle indexes, relationships, triggers, and stored procedures.

### Step 7: Write Unit Tests
Use Microsoft's Test framework to cover all major functionalities. Ensure each component is tested under various conditions, including edge cases.

### Step 8: Document and Compile
Add XML comments for each class and method. Ensure the solution compiles without errors using the latest .NET 9.0 features.

### Final Solution Structure
- **XBase.Core**:
  - DatabaseManager.cs
  - TableManager.cs
  - RecordManager.cs
  - QueryBuilder.cs
  - IQueryExecutor.cs
  - IDataAccess.cs
  - TableSchema.cs
  - Column.cs

- **XBase.Tests**:
  - UnitTests.cs (Multiple test files for each component)

### Conclusion
This structured approach ensures all X-BASE functionalities are implemented in a maintainable, testable manner. The solution is designed to be robust and scalable, adhering strictly to the specified coding guidelines.
