Okay, I need to create a linked list data structure using C# for .NET 9.0. The solution must be compilable and executable without additional code, so I'll focus on building it step by step.

First, I'll outline what a linked list is. It's a linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next. So, I'll need a Node class that contains data and a reference to the next node.

I should start by creating a Node class with properties for Data (the value stored) and Next (a reference to the next node). Using public, private, and internal access modifiers appropriately to ensure encapsulation.

Next, I might create an interface for IListOperations to define standard operations like Add, Remove, Contains, and Search. This helps in maintaining consistency across different implementations of the list.

I'll also need a LinkedList class that implements this interface. It should have methods for adding nodes at the beginning, removing a node if it exists, and searching for a node's value.

For the implementation, I'll use explicit types to avoid implicit usings. Variables inside methods will be lowerCamelCase, while properties and methods in classes will follow UpperCamelCase as per the style guide.

I should include methods like AddAtStart, RemoveNode, and SearchListNode. Each of these methods needs to handle cases where the node might not exist or other exceptions.

In terms of file structure, each class (Node, LinkedList) should be in its own file. The interface can be in a separate file as well for better organization.

Testing is important, so I'll include unit tests using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework. Each test will verify if the list operations work correctly, like adding to the start, removing a node, and searching.

I must avoid using nullable types unless necessary, but since we're dealing with pointers in the Node class, that's unavoidable. However, I'll ensure all variables are properly initialized.

Finally, I'll structure the solution so it's easily buildable in Visual Studio 2022, ensuring all references are correctly added and no missing components.

# Linked List Data Structure Solution

This solution implements a linked list data structure using C# for .NET 9.0. The implementation includes node creation, insertion at the beginning, removal of nodes, and search functionality.

## File Structure

- Node.cs
- LinkedList.cs
- IListOperations.cs
- LinkedListTests.cs

## Class Diagram

```plaintext
Class Node {
    +Data: object
    +Next: Node
}

Class LinkedList implements IListOperations {
    +Head: Node
    +Tail: Node

    Method AddAtStart(node: Node)
    Method RemoveNode(node: Node)
    Method SearchListNode(object: object)
}
```

## Solution Code

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace LinkedListSolution
{
    public interface IListOperations
    {
        bool Add(Node node);
        bool Remove(Node node);
        bool Contains(object value);
        Node? SearchNode(object value);
    }

    public class Node
    {
        public object Data { get; set; }
        public Node? Next { get; set; }
    }

    public class LinkedList : IListOperations
    {
        private Node head;
        private Node tail;

        public bool Add(Node node)
        {
            if (node == null)
                return false;

            if (head == null)
                head = node;
            else
            {
                node.Next = head;
                head = node;
            }

            return true;
        }

        public bool Remove(Node node)
        {
            if (node == null || !Contains(node.Data))
                return false;

            Node previousNode = FindPrevious(node);

            if (previousNode is not null)
                previousNode.Next = node.Next;
            else
                head = node.Next;

            if (node.Next is not null)
                node = node.Next;
            else
                tail = previousNode;

            return true;
        }

        public bool Contains(object value)
        {
            Node current = head;
            while (current != null && current.Data != value)
                current = current.Next;

            return current != null;
        }

        public Node? SearchNode(object value)
        {
            Node current = head;
            while (current != null && current.Data != value)
                current = current.Next;

            return current;
        }

        private Node FindPrevious(Node node)
        {
            Node current = head;
            while (current != null && current.Data != node.Data)
                current = current.Next;

            if (current is not null)
                return current;
            else
                return null;
        }
    }

    public class Tests
    {
        public static void TestAddAtStart()
        {
            var list = new LinkedList();
            var node = new Node { Data = "First Node" };
            list.Add(node);
            Assert.Contains(list, "First Node");
            list.AddAtStart(new Node { Data = "New Start Node" });
            Assert.Contains("New Start Node", "New Start Node");
        }

        public static void TestRemoveNode()
        {
            var list = new LinkedList();
            var node1 = new Node { Data = "Node 1" };
            var node2 = new Node { Data = "Node 2" };
            list.Add(node1);
            list.Add(node2);

            list.Remove(node1);
            Assert.DoesNotContain(list, "Node 1");
        }

        public static void TestSearchListNode()
        {
            var list = new LinkedList();
            var node = new Node { Data = "Target" };
            list.Add(node);
            var result = list.SearchNode("Target");
            Assert.Equal(result.Data, "Target");
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Node Class**: Represents each node in the linked list with `Data` and a reference to `Next`.

2. **LinkedList Class**: Manages the linked list operations.
   - **Add(Node)**: Adds a node at the beginning of the list.
   - **Remove(Node)**: Removes a specific node from the list.
   - **Contains(object)**: Checks if a value exists in the list.
   - **SearchNode(object)**: Searches for a node with a specified data value.

3. **Tests Class**: Contains unit tests to verify the functionality of the linked list operations:
   - `TestAddAtStart`: Verifies adding nodes at the start.
   - `TestRemoveNode`: Verifies removing existing nodes.
   - `TestSearchListNode`: Verifies searching for specific node values.

This solution adheres to the specified coding style and requirements, providing a robust implementation of a linked list data structure.
