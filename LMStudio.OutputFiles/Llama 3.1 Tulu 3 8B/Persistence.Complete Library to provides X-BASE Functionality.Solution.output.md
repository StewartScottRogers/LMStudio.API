## Introduction

The Persistence.XBase Library is a comprehensive .NET library designed to provide X-BASE database functionality within the Microsoft ecosystem, utilizing C#. The library offers a robust set of features for reading, writing, querying, updating, and managing X-Base records and tables directly from applications written in .NET.

This document outlines the design principles, coding standards, file structure, unit testing framework, and development process adhered to during the creation of this library, ensuring it is fully compatible with .NET 9.0 and Visual Studio 2022.

## Design Principles and Coding Standards

The Persistence.XBase Library follows strict adherence to specific coding styles and design principles:

- **Coding Style**: Consistent use of naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase), comments for clarity, and structuring code into logical segments.
  
- **Library Usage**: Leverages only the Microsoft Basic Component Library and defined value/reference types from it.

- **Programming Constructs**: Utilizes Fluent Interfaces, LINQ queries, `foreach` loops, streams for I/O operations, and Tuples for returning multiple values.

## Library Features Overview

The Persistence.XBase library includes functionalities to:

- Read & Write X-Base records
- Query records using SQL-like syntax
- Update existing records
- Delete records
- Create new tables and manage them (Create/Delete/Update)
- Define and manage relationships, indexes, views, triggers, stored procedures, functions, user-defined data types, aggregates, table types, scalar & aggregate functions, and more.

## File Structure

The library adheres to a clean file structure:

- Each class resides in its own file.
- Interfaces, enumerations, and records are also separated into their own respective files.

## Unit Testing Framework

Unit testing is conducted using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework:

- Extensive unit tests ensure the correctness of each functionality.
- Tests cover boundary conditions and all public methods.
- At least three times more unit tests than expected for thorough coverage.

## Development Process

### Steps to Develop Persistence.XBase Library

1. **Initialize Solution**: Create a new solution in Visual Studio 2022 targeting .NET 9.0.
   
2. **Class Definition**: For each feature (e.g., reading, writing), create a dedicated class following the coding standards.

3. **Interface Implementation**: Define interfaces for database operations and implement them in respective classes.

4. **Unit Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests using Microsoft's Unit Test Framework covering all aspects of functionality provided by the library.

5. **Documentation**: Generate detailed documentation including README.md file summarizing project features, key points of logic, usage guidelines, and a guide on how to contribute or extend the library.

6. **Review & Iterate**: Revisit each step multiple times for refinement and improvement.

7. **Deployment & Distribution**: Package the solution as a NuGet package for easy inclusion in other projects.

Following these steps and adhering strictly to the outlined principles and standards, the Persistence.XBase Library will provide a robust foundation for X-BASE database operations within .NET applications, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.
