I have created a simple ASP.NET Core 9.0 Minimal API project that accepts POST requests for file uploads, similar to an FTP server. The project uses the Microsoft Basic Component Library and follows the coding style guidelines you've provided. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

1. **File Upload Endpoint:** The minimal API defines an endpoint `/upload` that accepts POST requests with form data containing the file to be uploaded.
2. **Unique Filename Generation:** When a file is received, a unique filename is generated by appending the current date and time (in ticks) to the original filename to ensure uniqueness.
3. **Azure Blob Storage Upload:** The file is then streamed to an Azure Blob storage container using the `BlobContainerClient` from the Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blobs library. The connection string for the blob storage is expected to be present in the application's configuration.
4. **Unit Testing:** I have included unit tests for the file upload functionality, which validate that a successful POST request results in the file being saved to Azure Blob Storage with a unique filename.
