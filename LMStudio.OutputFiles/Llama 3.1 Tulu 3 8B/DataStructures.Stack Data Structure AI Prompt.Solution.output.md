To create this library, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Initialize New Solution in Visual Studio

Open Visual Studio 2022 and select `Create a new project`. Choose **Class Library (.NET Framework)** and name it `StackLibrary`. Ensure that the target framework is set to .NET Framework 4.8 (or any other version you intend to support, but for compatibility and availability purposes, we'll stick with .NET Framework 4.8 here).

### Step 2: Define Classes

#### Stack Class
Create a new file named `Stack.cs`. Here's the initial skeleton for our stack:

```csharp
using System.Collections;

namespace StackLibrary
{
    public class Stack<T>
    {
        private const int DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 100;
        private int _topIndex;
        private T[] _items;

        // Constructor with optional capacity
        public Stack(int capacity = DEFAULT_CAPACITY)
        {
            _items = new T[capacity];
            _topIndex = -1; // Indicating an empty stack
        }

        // Other methods go here...
    }
}
```

#### Implementation

- **Push** method to add elements:

```csharp
public void Push(T item)
{
    if (_topIndex == _items.Length - 1) ThrowFullException();
    _items[++_topIndex] = item;
}

private void ThrowFullException()
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Stack is full");
}
```

- **Pop** method to remove and return the top element:

```csharp
public T Pop()
{
    if (_topIndex == -1) ThrowEmptyException();
    return _items[_topIndex--];
}

private void ThrowEmptyException()
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Stack is empty");
}
```

- **Peek** method to view the top element without removing it:

```csharp
public T Peek()
{
    if (_topIndex == -1) ThrowEmptyException();
    return _items[_topIndex];
}
```

- **IsEmpty** method to check if the stack is empty:

```csharp
public bool IsEmpty() => _topIndex < 0;
```

- **IsFull** method (optional, you may not need it depending on usage):

```csharp
public bool IsFull() => _topIndex == (_items.Length - 1);
```

### Step 3: Unit Tests

Create a new test project named `StackLibraryTests` and add tests for each operation of the stack.

#### Sample Test Code

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using StackLibrary;

namespace StackLibraryTests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class StackTest
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void Push_Pop_Test()
        {
            var stack = new Stack<int>();
            stack.Push(1);
            Assert.AreEqual(1, stack.Peek());
            Assert.AreEqual(1, stack.Pop());
            Assert.IsTrue(stack.IsEmpty());
        }

        // Add more tests as needed...
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Documentation

Add a `README.md` file in the root of your solution explaining how to use and test the library.

### Step 5: Compilation and Review

Compile the solution ensuring there are no errors. Review the logic, testing coverage, and documentation to ensure clarity and completeness.

This stack implementation provides basic functionality required for a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. Depending on your application needs, you might want to add more features like resizing arrays when reaching capacity or supporting multiple stacks within one instance. 

### Final Considerations

- Always refactor and optimize based on performance requirements.
- Ensure proper exception handling is in place where applicable.
- Document all public APIs clearly.

This provides a basic yet functional stack implementation in C# adhering to the guidelines specified, ready for usage and extension as per project needs.
