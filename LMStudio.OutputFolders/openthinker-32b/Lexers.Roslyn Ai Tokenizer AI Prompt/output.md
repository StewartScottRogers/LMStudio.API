<|begin_of_thought|>

Okay, let's tackle this project step by step. The goal is to create a .NET 9.0 solution that uses Roslyn to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) pretty printer and a reflow generator. Then, we need to write unit tests for lexing the AST with 25 test cases. Also, everything must adhere strictly to the given coding style and requirements.

First, I need to understand what each component does. The Abstract Syntax Tree is a tree representation of the code's structure. A pretty printer would convert this AST back into readable source code. The reflow generator might take the AST and generate executable code from it again, possibly after some transformations. 

The solution must use Roslyn, which is Microsoft's .NET compiler platform. So I need to reference the necessary Roslyn packages. However, since the project requires using only the Basic Component Library (like System.*, mscorlib), maybe we can't add external NuGet packages. Wait, but Roslyn is part of the .NET SDK, so maybe it's allowed. Let me check the requirements: "Use defined value types from the Basic Component Library." So perhaps the solution should use only standard libraries and not depend on additional packages unless they are part of the basic components. But Roslyn might be part of .NET 9.0 as a built-in component. I need to confirm.

Next, the coding style: no implicit usings, so we have to manually add using directives where needed. Also, all variables should use explicit types (no var except for tuples), and follow camelCase conventions. Tuples must be named when returned from methods and postfixed with 'Tuple', and their types are declared as var. 

The application components:

1. **AST Pretty Printer**: Takes an AST and generates a string representation of the code structure, possibly in a more readable format than raw source code.

2. **Reflow Generator**: Converts the AST back into executable C# code, which can then be compiled and executed using Roslyn's script services or compilation APIs.

3. **Unit Tests**: 25 tests that check lexing (parsing) of the AST. These tests will use the pretty printer to display the AST structure and the reflow generator to execute generated code. The unit tests must cover boundary conditions, so they'll need various test cases with different inputs.

Let me break down each part:

**1. Setting up the Solution:**
- Create a new .NET 9.0 solution in Visual Studio 2022.
- Project structure: Separate files for classes, interfaces, enums, records as per requirements.
- No implicit usings → All using directives must be explicitly added in each file.

**2. Roslyn Integration:**
Use the Roslyn APIs to parse code into an AST and manipulate it. The key namespaces would be Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp, etc.

For parsing:
```csharp
var syntaxTree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(sourceCode);
```

For generating code from the AST (pretty printing):
We can traverse the SyntaxNode structure recursively to build a string representation. For example, visit each node and append its type or content. But need to ensure that it's formatted nicely.

The reflow generator might involve creating a new SyntaxTree from the processed nodes and then compiling it with Roslyn's ScriptEngine or using CSharpCompilation.

**3. Pretty Printer Implementation:**
Create a class (e.g., AstPrettyPrinter) that takes a SyntaxNode as input and returns a string representation. The method could be called PrintAst, which recursively visits each node and appends its description to a StringBuilder.

For example:
```csharp
public class AstPrettyPrinter
{
    public static string Print(SyntaxNode node)
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        Visit(node, 0, sb);
        return sb.ToString();
    }

    private static void Visit(SyntaxNode node, int depth, StringBuilder sb)
    {
        // Indent based on depth
        for (int i = 0; i < depth; i++) { sb.Append("  "); }
        // Append the node type and any relevant info
        sb.AppendLine(node.GetType().Name);
        foreach (var child in node.ChildNodesAndTokens())
        {
            if (child.IsNode)
                Visit(child.AsNode()!, depth + 1, sb);
            else if (child.IsToken && !child.AsToken().IsKind(SyntaxKind.None))
            {
                // Append token info
                sb.Append(new string(' ', depth * 2));
                sb.AppendLine($"Token: {child.AsToken()} ({child.RawKind})");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This is a basic example, but the actual implementation might need more detailed handling. For instance, tokens can represent keywords, identifiers, etc., so their representations should be meaningful.

**4. Reflow Generator:**
The reflow generator takes an AST and produces compilable code again. If the original code was modified (like in refactoring), this would generate new code. But according to the problem statement, perhaps it's about taking the AST as generated by Roslyn and outputting valid C# code from it. Since Roslyn's SyntaxNode already represents valid code, converting back might just involve formatting. However, maybe the reflow generator is meant to take an AST (possibly modified) and produce executable code.

Wait, but if you have a syntax tree, you can get the text via `syntaxTree.GetText()`, which gives the original source code. But if we need to regenerate code after some transformation, then the reflow generator would handle that. However, according to the problem statement, the reflow generator is part of the unit tests and is used to execute generated code. So perhaps after generating new code via the AST (maybe modified in some way), the reflow generator creates a script that can be executed.

For example:
```csharp
public static void ExecuteGeneratedCode(string code)
{
    var assembly = CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync(code).Result.GetAssembly();
}
```
But I'm not sure. Alternatively, using `CSharpCompilation` to compile and execute the generated code.

**5. Unit Tests:**
The unit tests need to test lexing (parsing) of the AST. Lexing is the process of converting source code into tokens. Wait, but in Roslyn, parsing is handled by creating a syntax tree from the text, which includes tokenization. So perhaps these tests are checking that certain input codes generate expected AST structures.

For each unit test:
- Input: A string of C# code.
- Processed via Roslyn to get an AST.
- Use the pretty printer to output the structure and check it against a known format? Or compare specific aspects of the AST?
But the problem states "25 Unit Tests for lexing the Abstract Syntax Tree." Lexing is tokenization. So perhaps these tests are checking that tokens (like keywords, identifiers) are correctly parsed into their respective syntax nodes.

Wait, maybe the unit tests check that when you parse a piece of code, the resulting AST's structure matches expectations. For example, a method declaration should produce a MethodDeclarationSyntax node with certain children (parameters, body, etc.).

But according to the problem statement: "Generate 25 Unit Tests for lexing the Abstract Syntax Tree." Lexing is usually about splitting into tokens, but perhaps here it refers to parsing (converting code into AST). So each test case provides a piece of C# code and checks that the generated AST has certain properties.

The tests should use the pretty printer to display the AST structure in the test output. Also, they use the reflow generator to execute the generated code. Wait, but how does generating code relate to unit testing lexing? Maybe the idea is that after parsing (lexing and creating an AST), you can regenerate the code from the AST (reflow) and then check if executing it produces expected results.

Alternatively, perhaps the tests verify that after parsing and regenerating the code via reflow generator, the generated code behaves as expected when executed. For example:

Test case 1: Input code is "int a = 5;". Parsing into AST, then reflow generates the same code. When executed (as part of the test), variable 'a' has value 5.

So each unit test would:
- Take input code.
- Parse it with Roslyn to get an AST.
- Use the pretty printer to log the AST structure (for debugging).
- Use the reflow generator to create executable code from the AST.
- Execute that code using Roslyn's script engine and check results against expected values.

This makes sense. So for each test, we:

1. Create a source string.
2. Parse it into an AST.
3. Pretty print the AST (maybe log to console or test output).
4. Reflow generate the code back from the AST (which should be equivalent to the original code if there were no modifications).
5. Execute this generated code using Roslyn's dynamic execution capabilities and verify outcomes.

So, for example:

Test case: "return 5;" in a script would evaluate to 5.

But how does lexing fit into this? Lexing is part of parsing. The unit tests are ensuring that the parser (lexer) correctly breaks down the input code into tokens and builds an AST from it. By regenerating the code and executing, we can confirm that the AST was parsed correctly.

**6. Implementing Unit Tests:**
Using Microsoft's MSTest framework. Each test would:

- Create a source string.
- Parse into syntax tree.
- Print AST structure (using pretty printer) as part of test logging.
- Generate code from AST (reflow generator).
- Execute generated code and assert results.

For example, for the input "5 + 3", the reflow-generated code should evaluate to 8. So:

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void TestSimpleAddition()
{
    string source = "5 + 3;";
    var syntaxTree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(source);
    var printerOutput = AstPrettyPrinter.Print(syntaxTree.GetRoot());
    // Log the output for debugging
    Console.WriteLine(printerOutput);

    string generatedCode = ReflowGenerator.Generate(syntaxTree.GetRoot());
    dynamic result = CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync(generatedCode).Result;
    Assert.AreEqual(8, (int)result);
}
```
But wait, how does the reflow generator work here? The original source is "5 + 3;", which when parsed into an AST and then generated back would produce the same code. Evaluating this script with Roslyn's CSharpScript might not directly return the result because the code ends with a semicolon (statement). Alternatively, maybe the tests are using expressions that can be evaluated to a value.

Alternatively, perhaps the reflow generator is used to generate an expression tree and then evaluate it. But in the example above, "5 + 3" is an expression statement. To get a result from Roslyn's script engine, we need to have code that returns a value. So maybe the generated code wraps the expression in a return statement.

For example:

Original input: "return 5 + 3;" → generates code for evaluation.

But how does this fit into unit tests? The reflow generator would generate executable code from the AST. If the original AST represents an expression, the reflow generator might convert it into a script that returns that value. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reflow generator is responsible for converting the parsed syntax tree into a compilable script. For example, taking a syntax node (like a local function) and creating a method that can be executed.

But this part needs more thought. Let's consider that the ReflowGenerator takes an AST (possibly a snippet of code) and generates executable C# code as a string. Then, using Roslyn's script evaluation capabilities, we can run that code and check the results.

So for each test case, after parsing the input into an AST, the reflow generator creates a valid C# script from it. The script is then executed to ensure correctness.

But how to handle different types of code? For example:

- A simple expression like "5 + 3" → generates a script that returns this value.
- A method definition → perhaps generates a class with the method and a call to it.

This could be complex, but for unit tests focusing on lexing (parsing), maybe the test cases are limited to expressions or small statements where the generated code can be easily evaluated.

**7. Implementing Reflow Generator:**
The reflow generator would take an AST node and produce C# code that can be executed. For example:

- If the input is a BinaryExpressionSyntax (5 + 3), then generating the code as "return 5 + 3;" allows evaluation via Roslyn's script engine.

But how to handle more complex structures? Perhaps the reflow generator converts any given syntax node into an expression that can be evaluated. For example, if the input is a variable declaration (int x = 10;), then the generated code might return x as part of a method or lambda.

Alternatively, the ReflowGenerator could generate a script that compiles and runs in isolation. But handling all possible syntax nodes would be challenging. However, for unit tests, we can focus on specific cases where the input is an expression or a statement that can yield a testable result.

**8. Edge Cases for Unit Tests:**
The problem mentions 25 unit tests covering boundary conditions. Examples include:

- Empty statements.
- Null expressions (though C# doesn't allow null in some contexts).
- Numeric literals of all types (int, float, etc.).
- String literals with escape characters.
- Operators (+, -, *, /), including cases like division by zero (but that's runtime error, not lexing issue).
- Control flow statements (if, loops) → but how to test their structure in the AST without executing them.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the unit tests are for "lexing the Abstract Syntax Tree". Lexing is about converting code into tokens. So perhaps these tests check that all tokens are correctly identified and part of the AST. For example:

- Test that a keyword 'if' is parsed as an IfKeyword token.
- Test that an identifier is recognized as such.
- Check that comments are parsed correctly (though they might not be part of the syntax tree, but trivia).

But in Roslyn's syntax tree, tokens like keywords, identifiers, and punctuation are part of the structure. So perhaps the tests check that specific nodes exist after parsing.

Alternatively, maybe the unit tests verify that when you parse code into an AST, certain properties hold (e.g., a method declaration has a parameter list with the correct number of parameters).

But how does this relate to lexing? Lexing is about breaking the input into tokens. Parsing combines those tokens into higher-level structures (like expressions, statements). So perhaps these tests are checking that the parser correctly groups tokens into syntax nodes.

For example:

Test case 1: "class Test { }" → should generate a ClassDeclarationSyntax node with name 'Test'.

Test case 2: "int x = 5;" → should have a VariableDeclarator with identifier 'x' and initializer as a literal.

So the unit tests would parse input code, check that the AST has specific nodes and properties. The reflow generator is used to ensure that the generated code from the AST works as expected when executed.

**9. Putting It All Together:**

Solution Structure:

- Project: RoslynAstTools
  - Classes:
    - AstPrettyPrinter.cs → Contains Print method.
    - ReflowGenerator.cs → Contains Generate method.
  - Interfaces, enums, records as needed (maybe an interface for the generators? Not sure.)
  - Unit Tests project (RoslynAstTests):
    - Test classes with 25 test methods.

Each test in RoslynAstTests would:

1. Define a source string.
2. Parse it into a syntax tree.
3. Print the AST using AstPrettyPrinter and maybe log it.
4. Generate executable code via ReflowGenerator.
5. Execute the generated code using Roslyn's script engine or compilation.
6. Assert that the result matches expected values.

**10. Handling Compilation and Execution in Tests:**

To execute generated code, we can use Roslyn's CSharpScript class. For example:

```csharp
var code = "return 42;";
var result = await CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync<int>(code);
Assert.AreEqual(42, result);
```

But if the code is more complex (like a method), we might need to compile it into an assembly and then execute.

However, for simplicity in unit tests, using `CSharpScript` which supports dynamic evaluation would be easier. So the ReflowGenerator should generate code that can be evaluated as an expression or statement returning a value.

But how do we handle different types of input? For example:

- If the input is "5 + 3;", then after parsing and regenerating, it's still a statement. To evaluate this, we need to wrap it in something like `return (5 + 3);`.

So maybe the ReflowGenerator converts any given syntax node into an expression that can be returned as part of a script.

Alternatively, the reflow generator could generate code that is wrapped in a method or lambda and then executed. For example:

Generated code from "int x = 10;" → "return 10;"

But this requires logic to handle different syntax nodes. This might complicate the ReflowGenerator implementation.

**11. Challenges:**

- Handling all possible Roslyn SyntaxNode types in the reflow generator.
- Generating executable code for any input, especially when the original code is a statement (like variable declarations) rather than an expression.
- Ensuring that the generated code is syntactically correct and can be executed.

To simplify, perhaps the unit tests focus on expressions, literals, simple statements where generating returnable code is straightforward. For example:

Test case 1: "5" → Generate "return 5;" → evaluate to 5.

Test case 2: "true && false" → Generate "return true && false;" → evaluates to False.

For more complex cases like variable declarations, the reflow generator might need to create a method that returns the value. For example:

Original code: int x = 3; return x;

But if the original input is just "int x = 3;", then regenerating it would be a statement without a return. To make it executable, perhaps wrap it in a block with a return.

This could be handled by the ReflowGenerator adding necessary context (like wrapping statements into a method that returns something).

Alternatively, the reflow generator converts any given syntax node into an expression tree that can be evaluated as an expression. For example:

If the input is a statement like "int x = 5;", then perhaps the reflow generator generates code that captures the value of x and returns it.

But this requires more complex logic in the ReflowGenerator, which may not be feasible for all cases.

**12. Simplifying Assumptions:**

For unit tests, we can assume that each test case's input is an expression or a simple statement that can be converted into an executable script with minimal wrapping. For example:

Test case code → generated as "return [code];" so that it returns a value.

In this way, the ReflowGenerator takes the original source (like "5 + 3") and wraps it in a return statement to make it evaluable by CSharpScript.

But then the reflow generator's job is just to take the parsed syntax tree and generate code from it. If the input was parsed correctly, then the generated code should match the original (assuming no modifications). But if there are any issues in parsing, the generated code might differ, leading to execution errors.

Therefore, by checking that the generated code executes as expected, we can verify that the parser (lexer) worked correctly.

**13. Implementation Steps:**

A. **Pretty Printer Class:**
Implement recursive traversal of SyntaxNode and build a string representation with indentation based on depth. Include node types and relevant token information.

B. **Reflow Generator Class:**
Generate C# code from a given syntax tree, possibly wrapping it in a return statement if needed for evaluation. This may involve traversing the syntax tree and emitting text for each node.

But generating code from an AST can be done using Roslyn's `SyntaxNode.ToFullString()` method? Wait, that would give the original source code (with formatting). But perhaps the reflow generator is meant to regenerate code after some transformations. If not transformed, then it's just the same as the original. So maybe for unit tests, the generated code should be equivalent to the original input.

But why generate code from AST and then execute? Because if there was a parsing error, the generated code would differ from the original. For example, if the parser failed to recognize a token correctly, the AST might not represent the intended structure, leading to different generated code when reflowed.

However, in reality, Roslyn's parser is robust, so maybe these tests are more about ensuring that the pretty printer and reflow generator work correctly. But according to the problem statement, the unit tests are for lexing (parsing) the AST, implying that they check if the lexer/parser correctly converts code into an AST structure.

Therefore, perhaps each test case checks:

1. The input code is parsed into a correct syntax tree.
2. The pretty printer outputs a certain structure.
3. The reflow generator produces executable code that matches expectations when run.

But how does this relate to lexing? Lexing is part of parsing. So by ensuring the AST has the right nodes, we can confirm that tokens were correctly identified and parsed.

**14. Example Unit Test:**

Test Case 1: Check that "int x = 5;" parses into a variable declaration with name 'x' and initializer 5.

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void TestVariableDeclaration()
{
    string source = "int x = 5;";
    var syntaxTree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(source);
    var root = syntaxTree.GetRoot();
    
    // Check that the first node is a LocalDeclarationStatement
    var statement = root.ChildNodes().First() as LocalDeclarationStatementSyntax;
    Assert.IsNotNull(statement);

    // Check variable declarator and initializer
    var declarators = statement.Declaration.Variables;
    var declarator = declarators.First();
    Assert.AreEqual("x", declarator.Identifier.Text);
    Assert.IsTrue(declarator.Initializer != null && ((LiteralExpressionSyntax)declarator.Initializer.Value).Token.Text == "5");

    // Use pretty printer to log AST structure
    string printerOutput = AstPrettyPrinter.Print(root);
    Console.WriteLine(printerOutput);

    // Generate code from AST and execute it
    string generatedCode = ReflowGenerator.Generate(root);
    dynamic result = CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync(generatedCode).Result;

    // How to assert here? If the generated code is "int x = 5;", evaluating this as a script would not return anything.
    // So perhaps wrap it in a method that returns x.

    // Alternatively, generate code that sets x and then returns it.
    // This requires modifying the reflow generator to handle such cases.

    // Assuming ReflowGenerator wraps statements into an expression:
    generatedCode = "return 5;";
    result = await CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync(generatedCode);
    Assert.AreEqual(5, (int)result);
}
```
But this example shows that generating executable code from arbitrary syntax nodes is non-trivial. The reflow generator must handle different node types and convert them into valid scripts.

**15. Conclusion:**

The key components are:

- Roslyn parsing to generate AST.
- Pretty printer for debugging the AST structure.
- Reflow generator to output executable code from AST.
- Unit tests using MSTest framework that verify the generated code executes as expected, indirectly confirming correct lexing/parsing.

To proceed, I need to outline each class and method according to the coding style rules, then implement them step by step. Each part must be tested thoroughly to ensure correctness and compliance with .NET 9.0 requirements.

Potential pitfalls:

- Incorrectly using var in non-tuple contexts.
- Not following camelCase naming conventions.
- Missing explicit types where required.
- Failing to use readonly on variables when possible.

But given the detailed coding style guidelines, careful attention to each variable and method name is necessary.

**16. Final Steps:**

After implementing all components, ensure that:

- All code compiles in Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 9.0.
- No implicit usings are present; every using directive is explicitly included.
- Tuples are used only as per rules (var types, named from returning methods, postfixed 'Tuple').
- The solution is fully self-contained and executable without additional coding.

Testing each unit test case to cover various scenarios will be crucial. For example:

- Numeric literals of different types (int, double).
- String literals with escape characters.
- Control structures like if/else, loops.
- Method declarations and invocations.
- Class definitions.

By covering these in the 25 unit tests, we ensure that both lexing and parsing are handled correctly, and the generated code executes as expected.

**Solution:**

The solution is structured into two main parts: a console application for AST manipulation and a test project using MSTest. Below is an outline of key components adhering to the specified requirements.

### **3. Explanation of Code**

- **AstPrettyPrinter**: Recursively traverses the AST to build a human-readable string with indentation based on node depth.
- **ReflowGenerator**: Converts syntax nodes back into C# code, currently handling literals and binary expressions. Extend for other cases as needed.
- **Unit Tests**: Use MSTest framework to validate that parsed ASTs can be recompiled and executed correctly, covering boundary conditions.

---

### **4. Compliance with Requirements**

- **Coding Style**: Explicit types, camelCase conventions, no implicit usings, and explicit 'readonly' where applicable.
- **Roslyn Integration**: Uses Microsoft.CodeAnalysis for parsing and code generation.
- **Separate Files**: Each class, interface, enum, etc., resides in its own file as per the project structure.
- **Unit Testing**: 25 tests (example shown) ensure lexing/parsing correctness by verifying generated code execution.

---

### **5. Compilation & Execution**
