 To create the described application, we'll need to set up a .NET 9.0 solution in Visual Studio 2022 following strict coding standards and best practices. The solution will include a minimal API for an FTP-like server to handle file uploads and store them in Azure Blob Storage with unique timestamps.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Solution

1. **Open Visual Studio 2022**.
2. **Create a new Project**: Go to `File > New > Project`. Choose `.NET Core Console App` for the minimal API and name it `BatchUploader`.
3. **Add Additional Projects**: Add more projects as needed:
   - A class library for shared components (`SharedLibrary`).
   - Another class library for business logic (`BusinessLogic`).
   - And another for data access (`DataAccess`).
4. **Set Up the Solution Structure**: Ensure each project has its own namespace and is properly isolated.

### Step 2: Implementing the Minimal API

1. **Create a minimal API endpoint** in `BatchUploader`:
    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();
    var app = builder.Build();

    app.MapPost("/upload", async context =>
    {
        // Logic to handle file upload and store it in Azure Blob Storage
    });

    app.Run();
    ```
2. **Integrate with BusinessLogic**: Create a service or method in `BusinessLogic` for handling the business logic of uploading files.
3. **Integrate with DataAccess**: Use `DataAccess` to handle interactions with Azure Blob Storage.
4. **Handle File Uploads and Blobs**: Implement methods to read file data from the request, generate unique timestamps, and upload to Azure Blob Storage using Azure's storage SDK.

### Step 3: Business Logic

1. **Create a Service** in `BusinessLogic` for handling uploads. This service should include:
    ```csharp
    public class UploadService
    {
        private readonly IDataAccess _dataAccess;

        public UploadService(IDataAccess dataAccess)
        {
            _dataAccess = dataAccess;
        }

        public async Task<bool> HandleUploadAsync(HttpRequest request, string containerName)
        {
            // Logic to process the upload
        }
    }
    ```
2. **Implement File Handling**: Ensure that file reading and writing operations are handled correctly within this service.

### Step 4: Data Access

1. **Create Interfaces** in `DataAccess` for Azure Blob Storage interactions:
    ```csharp
    public interface IBlobStorageService
    {
        Task<string> UploadFileAsync(Stream fileStream, string fileName);
    }
    ```
2. **Implement the Interface**: Create a class that implements this interface to handle actual blob operations using Azure's storage library.

### Step 5: Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests in each project using Microsoft’s Unit Test Framework. Focus on testing all edge cases and scenarios including file upload failures, successful uploads, and error handling.
2. **Mocking**: Use mocking frameworks if necessary to isolate units for pure testing without Azure interactions during development.

### Step 6: Documentation

1. **Project Documentation**.
   - Create a `README` or similar documentation in the root folder of the solution explaining:
     - The purpose and functionality of each part of the system (BatchUploader, SharedLibrary, BusinessLogic, DataAccess).
     - How to set up and run the application.
     - Any dependencies or prerequisites needed for the project like Azure Storage Account setup.
2. **Code Comments**: Ensure all methods are commented adequately so that a business analyst could understand the logic without needing deep programming knowledge.

### Step 7: Final Adjustments

1. Test the solution thoroughly across different environments and scenarios to ensure robustness.
2. Refine documentation as needed based on testing feedback or clarifications from stakeholders.
3. Ensure all coding standards are strictly adhered to throughout the entire codebase.

This structured approach will help in developing a robust, maintainable, and efficient FTP-like server using .NET 9.0 with Azure Blob Storage integration.
