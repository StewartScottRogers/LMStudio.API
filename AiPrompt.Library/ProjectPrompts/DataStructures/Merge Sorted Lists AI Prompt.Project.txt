# Application Description

	- Create an in-memory library that Merges sorted lists of integers. 
	- The library should provide a method that takes N sorted lists of generics and returns a single sorted list of integers that contains all elements from the input lists. The output list should not contain any duplicates.
	- The library should be able to handle large lists efficiently.
	- The library should be able to handle a large number of input lists.
	- The library should be able to handle a large number of elements in the input lists.
	- The library should be able to handle null or empty input lists.
	- The library should be made available as a fluent interface to allow for easy chaining of operations.
	- The library should be well-documented with comments explaining the logic and structure of the code.
	- The library should be comparable with LINQ and other standard C# libraries.
