I will provide you with a high-level outline of how the solution could be structured, including main classes and interfaces. This is not a complete implementation but rather an overview that adheres to your specifications.

### Solution Structure

1. **Core**
   - **IMergeableList.cs**: Interface defining merge method.
   - **MergeableList.cs**: Implementation of IMergeableList.
2. **Extensions**
   - **MergingExtensions.cs**: Extension methods for merging lists.
3. **Tests**
   - **MergableListTests.cs**: Unit tests for MergeableList.

### Core

#### IMergeableList.cs
```csharp
public interface IMergeableList<T> where T : IComparable<T>
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Merges the given list of lists into a single sorted list.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="lists">The lists to merge.</param>
    /// <returns>A merged and sorted list containing all elements from the input lists.</returns>
    IEnumerable<T> Merge(IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> lists);
}
```

#### MergeableList.cs
```csharp
public class MergeableList<T> : IMergeableList<T> where T : IComparable<T>
{
    public readonly List<T> MergedList = new();

    public IEnumerable<T> Merge(IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> lists)
    {
        // Implementation of the merge process, leveraging T's IComparable interface.
    }
}
```

### Extensions

#### MergingExtensions.cs
```csharp
public static class MergingExtensions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Merges a list of sorted lists into a single sorted list using a fluent interface.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="source">The first list to merge.</param>
    /// <param name="additionalLists">Additional lists to merge with the source.</param>
    /// <returns>A merged and sorted list containing all elements from the input lists.</returns>
    public static IEnumerable<T> MergeWith(this IMergeableList<T> source, params IEnumerable<T>[] additionalLists)
        => source.Merge(additionalLists.Select(list => list.AsEnumerable()));
}
```

### Tests

#### MergableListTests.cs
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MergableListTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Merge_ReturnsSingleSortedList_WithAllElements()
    {
        // Arrange
        var lists = new List<IEnumerable<int>>()
        {
            Enumerable.Range(1, 5),
            Enumerable.Range(6, 3)
        };
        
        // Act
        var mergedList = new MergeableList<int>().Merge(lists);
        
        // Assert
        // Add assertions to validate the output.
    }
}
```

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure that `T` implements `IComparable<T>` or provide custom comparers for different types of data.
- Implement error handling for null or empty input lists.
- Optimize performance for large and numerous inputs, possibly by implementing a more efficient merge process than the standard O(n log n) algorithm.
- Consider using parallel processing techniques to improve efficiency when merging large datasets.

This outline provides a starting point. Each method and class would require detailed implementation, testing, and optimization based on specific requirements and constraints.
