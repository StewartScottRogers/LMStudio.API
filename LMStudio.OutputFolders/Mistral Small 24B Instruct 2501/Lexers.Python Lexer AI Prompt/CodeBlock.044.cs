To create a .NET 9.0 Solution for lexing the given grammar and generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with a Pretty Printer, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Solution in Visual Studio**:
   - Create a new solution named `PythonLexerSolution`.
   - Add a Class Library project named `PythonLexer`.

2. **Define the Project Structure**:
   - Create separate files for each class, interface, enumeration, and record.

3. **Develop the Lexer**:
   - Implement a lexer that can parse the given grammar.
   - Generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the input.

4. **Develop the AST Pretty Printer**:
   - Create a pretty printer to display the AST in a readable format.

5. **Generate Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests to ensure the lexer and AST generation are working correctly.

Below is the solution structure and code for the described .NET 9.0 Class Library using C#.
